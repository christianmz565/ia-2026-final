Model efﬁciency has become increasingly important in

computer vision. In this paper, we systematically study neu-

ral network architecture design choices for object detec-

tion and propose several key optimizations to improve ef-

ﬁciency. First, we propose a weighted bi-directional fea-

ture pyramid network (BiFPN), which allows easy and fast

multi-scale feature fusion; Second, we propose a compound

scaling method that uniformly scales the resolution, depth,

and width for all backbone, feature network, and box/class

prediction networks at the same time. Based on these op-

timizations and EfﬁcientNet backbones, we have developed

a new family of object detectors, called EfﬁcientDet, which

consistently achieve much better efﬁciency than prior art

across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In partic-

ular, with single-model and single-scale, our EfﬁcientDet-

D7 achieves state-of-the-art 52.2 AP on COCO test-dev

with 52M parameters and 325B FLOPs1, being 4x – 9x

smaller and using 13x – 42x fewer FLOPs than previous de-

tector. Code is available at https://github.com/google/

or compress existing models [25, 26]. Although these meth-

ods tend to achieve better efﬁciency, they usually sacriﬁce

accuracy. Moreover, most previous works only focus on a

speciﬁc or a small range of resource requirements, but the

variety of real-world applications, from mobile devices to

datacenters, often demand different resource constraints.

1. Introduction

Tremendous progresses have been made in recent years

towards more accurate object detection; meanwhile, state-

of-the-art object detectors also become increasingly more

expensive. For example, the latest AmoebaNet-based NAS-

FPN detector [42] requires 167M parameters and 3045B

FLOPs (30x more than RetinaNet [21]) to achieve state-of-

the-art accuracy. The large model sizes and expensive com-

putation costs deter their deployment in many real-world

applications such as robotics and self-driving cars where

model size and latency are highly constrained. Given these

real-world resource constraints, model efﬁciency becomes

increasingly important for object detection.

A natural question is: Is it possible to build a scal-

able detection architecture with both higher accuracy and

better efﬁciency across a wide spectrum of resource con-

straints (e.g., from 3B to 300B FLOPs)? This paper aims

to tackle this problem by systematically studying various

design choices of detector architectures. Based on the one-

stage detector paradigm, we examine the design choices for

backbone, feature fusion, and class/box network, and iden-

tify two main challenges:

There have been many previous works aiming to de-

velop more efﬁcient detector architectures, such as one-

scale feature fusion. Recently, PANet [23], NAS-FPN [8],

and other studies [17, 15, 39] have developed more network

structures for cross-scale feature fusion. While fusing dif-

ferent input features, most previous works simply sum them

up without distinction; however, since these different input

features are at different resolutions, we observe they usu-

ally contribute to the fused output feature unequally. To

address this issue, we propose a simple yet highly effective

weighted bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN),

which introduces learnable weights to learn the importance

of different input features, while repeatedly applying top-

down and bottom-up multi-scale feature fusion.

have attracted substantial attention due to their efﬁciency

and simplicity [18, 39, 41]. In this paper, we mainly follow

the one-stage detector design, and we show it is possible

to achieve both better efﬁciency and higher accuracy with

optimized network architectures.

Multi-Scale Feature Representations:

One of the main

difﬁculties in object detection is to effectively represent and

process multi-scale features. Earlier detectors often directly

perform predictions based on the pyramidal feature hierar-

chy extracted from backbone networks [2, 24, 33]. As one

of the pioneering works, feature pyramid network (FPN)

[20] proposes a top-down pathway to combine multi-scale

features.

Following this idea, PANet [23] adds an extra

bottom-up path aggregation network on top of FPN; STDL

[40] proposes a scale-transfer module to exploit cross-scale

features; M2det [39] proposes a U-shape module to fuse

multi-scale features, and G-FRNet [1] introduces gate units

for controlling information ﬂow across features. More re-

cently, NAS-FPN [8] leverages neural architecture search to

automatically design feature network topology. Although it

achieves better performance, NAS-FPN requires thousands

of GPU hours during search, and the resulting feature net-

work is irregular and thus difﬁcult to interpret. In this paper,

we aim to optimize multi-scale feature fusion with a more

intuitive and principled way.

Challenge 2: model scaling –

While previous works

mainly rely on bigger backbone networks [21, 32, 31, 8] or

larger input image sizes [11, 42] for higher accuracy, we ob-

serve that scaling up feature network and box/class predic-

tion network is also critical when taking into account both

accuracy and efﬁciency. Inspired by recent works [36], we

propose a compound scaling method for object detectors,

which jointly scales up the resolution/depth/width for all

backbone, feature network, box/class prediction network.

Finally, we also observe that the recently introduced Efﬁ-

cientNets [36] achieve better efﬁciency than previous com-

monly used backbones. Combining EfﬁcientNet backbones

with our propose BiFPN and compound scaling, we have

developed a new family of object detectors, named Efﬁ-

cientDet, which consistently achieve better accuracy with

much fewer parameters and FLOPs than previous object

detectors.

Figure 1 and Figure 4 show the performance

comparison on COCO dataset [22]. Under similar accu-

racy constraint, our EfﬁcientDet uses 28x fewer FLOPs than

YOLOv3 [31], 30x fewer FLOPs than RetinaNet [21], and

19x fewer FLOPs than the recent ResNet based NAS-FPN

[8]. In particular, with single-model and single test-time

scale, our EfﬁcientDet-D7 achieves state-of-the-art 52.2 AP

with 52M parameters and 325B FLOPs, outperforming pre-

vious best detector [42] with 1.5 AP while being 4x smaller

and using 13x fewer FLOPs. Our EfﬁcientDet is also up to

3x to 8x faster on GPU/CPU than previous detectors.

With simple modiﬁcations, we also demonstrate that

our single-model single-scale EfﬁcientDet achieves 81.74%

mIOU accuracy with 18B FLOPs on Pascal VOC 2012 se-

mantic segmentation, outperforming DeepLabV3+ [4] by

1.7% better accuracy with 9.8x fewer FLOPs.

Model Scaling:

In order to obtain better accuracy, it

is common to scale up a baseline detector by employing

bigger backbone networks (e.g., from mobile-size models

[35, 13] and ResNet [12], to ResNeXt [38] and AmoebaNet

[29]), or increasing input image size (e.g., from 512x512

[21] to 1536x1536 [42]). Some recent works [8, 42] show

that increasing the channel size and repeating feature net-

works can also lead to higher accuracy.

These scaling

methods mostly focus on single or limited scaling dimen-

sions. Recently, [36] demonstrates remarkable model efﬁ-

ciency for image classiﬁcation by jointly scaling up network

width, depth, and resolution. Our proposed compound scal-

ing method for object detection is mostly inspired by [36].

3. BiFPN

In this section, we ﬁrst formulate the multi-scale feature

fusion problem, and then introduce the main ideas for our

proposed BiFPN: efﬁcient bidirectional cross-scale connec-

tions and weighted feature fusion.

One-Stage Detectors:

Existing object detectors are

mostly categorized by whether they have a region-of-

interest proposal step (two-stage [9, 32, 3, 11]) or not (one-

stage [33, 24, 30, 21]). While two-stage detectors tend to be

more ﬂexible and more accurate, one-stage detectors are of-

ten considered to be simpler and more efﬁcient by leverag-

ing predeﬁned anchors [14]. Recently, one-stage detectors

efﬁciency, this paper proposes several optimizations for

cross-scale connections: First, we remove those nodes that

only have one input edge.

Our intuition is simple: if a

node has only one input edge with no feature fusion, then

it will have less contribution to feature network that aims

at fusing different features. This leads to a simpliﬁed bi-

directional network; Second, we add an extra edge from the

original input to output node if they are at the same level,

in order to fuse more features without adding much cost;

Third, unlike PANet [23] that only has one top-down and

one bottom-up path, we treat each bidirectional (top-down

& bottom-up) path as one feature network layer, and repeat

the same layer multiple times to enable more high-level fea-

ture fusion. Section 4.2 will discuss how to determine the

number of layers for different resource constraints using a

compound scaling method. With these optimizations, we

name the new feature network as bidirectional feature pyra-

mid network (BiFPN), as shown in Figure 2 and 3.

3.3. Weighted Feature Fusion

Conventional top-down FPN is inherently limited by the

one-way information ﬂow. To address this issue, PANet

[23] adds an extra bottom-up path aggregation network, as

shown in Figure 2(b). Cross-scale connections are further

studied in [17, 15, 39]. Recently, NAS-FPN [8] employs

neural architecture search to search for better cross-scale

feature network topology, but it requires thousands of GPU

hours during search and the found network is irregular and

difﬁcult to interpret or modify, as shown in Figure 2(c).


---
*Page 3*


When fusing features with different resolutions, a com-

mon way is to ﬁrst resize them to the same resolution and

then sum them up. Pyramid attention network [19] intro-

duces global self-attention upsampling to recover pixel lo-

calization, which is further studied in [8].

All previous

methods treat all input features equally without distinction.

However, we observe that since different input features are

at different resolutions, they usually contribute to the output

feature unequally. To address this issue, we propose to add

an additional weight for each input, and let the network to

learn the importance of each input feature. Based on this

idea, we consider three weighted fusion approaches:


---
*Page 3*


By studying the performance and efﬁciency of these

three networks (Table 5), we observe that PANet achieves

better accuracy than FPN and NAS-FPN, but with the cost

of more parameters and computations. To improve model

learnable weight that can be a scalar (per-feature), a vec-

tor (per-channel), or a multi-dimensional tensor (per-pixel).

We ﬁnd a scale can achieve comparable accuracy to other

approaches with minimal computational costs. However,

since the scalar weight is unbounded, it could potentially

cause training instability. Therefore, we resort to weight

normalization to bound the value range of each weight.

4.1. EfﬁcientDet Architecture

Figure 3 shows the overall architecture of EfﬁcientDet,

which largely follows the one-stage detectors paradigm

[24, 30, 20, 21].

We employ ImageNet-pretrained Efﬁ-

cientNets as the backbone network. Our proposed BiFPN

serves as the feature network, which takes level 3-7 features

{P3, P4, P5, P6, P7} from the backbone network and re-

peatedly applies top-down and bottom-up bidirectional fea-

ture fusion. These fused features are fed to a class and box

network to produce object class and bounding box predic-

tions respectively. Similar to [21], the class and box net-

work weights are shared across all levels of features.

idea is to apply softmax to each weight, such that all weights

are normalized to be a probability with value range from 0

to 1, representing the importance of each input. However,

as shown in our ablation study in section 6.3, the extra soft-

max leads to signiﬁcant slowdown on GPU hardware. To

minimize the extra latency cost, we further propose a fast

fusion approach.

4.2. Compound Scaling

Aiming at optimizing both accuracy and efﬁciency, we

would like to develop a family of models that can meet

a wide spectrum of resource constraints. A key challenge

here is how to scale up a baseline EfﬁcientDet model.

wi ≥0 is ensured by applying a Relu after each wi, and

ϵ = 0.0001 is a small value to avoid numerical instability.

Similarly, the value of each normalized weight also falls

between 0 and 1, but since there is no softmax operation

here, it is much more efﬁcient. Our ablation study shows

this fast fusion approach has very similar learning behavior

and accuracy as the softmax-based fusion, but runs up to

30% faster on GPUs (Table 6).

*Page 4*


Previous works mostly scale up a baseline detector by

employing bigger backbone networks (e.g., ResNeXt [38]

or AmoebaNet [29]), using larger input images, or stacking

more FPN layers [8]. These methods are usually ineffective

since they only focus on a single or limited scaling dimen-

sions. Recent work [36] shows remarkable performance on

image classiﬁcation by jointly scaling up all dimensions of

network width, depth, and input resolution.

Inspired by

these works [8, 36], we propose a new compound scaling

method for object detection, which uses a simple compound

coefﬁcient φ to jointly scale up all dimensions of backbone

network, BiFPN network, class/box network, and resolu-

tion. Unlike [36], object detectors have much more scaling

dimensions than image classiﬁcation models, so grid search

for all dimensions is prohibitive expensive. Therefore, we

use a heuristic-based scaling approach, but still follow the

main idea of jointly scaling up all dimensions.

Our ﬁnal BiFPN integrates both the bidirectional cross-

scale connections and the fast normalized fusion. As a con-

crete example, here we describe the two fused features at

feature fusion, and add batch normalization and activation

after each convolution.

we linearly increase BiFPN depth

Dbifpn (#layers) since depth needs to be rounded to small

integers. For BiFPN width Wbifpn (#channels), exponen-

tially grow BiFPN width Wbifpn (#channels) as similar to

[36]. Speciﬁcally, we perform a grid search on a list of val-

ues {1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4, 1.45}, and pick the best value

1.35 as the BiFPN width scaling factor. Formally, BiFPN

width and depth are scaled with the following equation:

We evaluate EfﬁcientDet on COCO 2017 detection

datasets [22] with 118K training images.

Each model

is trained using SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9 and

weight decay 4e-5. Learning rate is linearly increased from

0 to 0.16 in the ﬁrst training epoch and then annealed down

using cosine decay rule. Synchronized batch normalization

is added after every convolution with batch norm decay 0.99

and epsilon 1e-3. Same as the [36], we use swish activation

[28, 6] and exponential moving average with decay 0.9998.

We also employ commonly-used focal loss [21] with α =

0.25 and γ = 1.5, and aspect ratio {1/2, 1, 2}. Each model

is trained with batch size 128 on 32 TPUv3 cores with batch

size 4 per core. We use RetinaNet [21] preprocessing with

training-time multi-resolution cropping/scaling and ﬂipping

augmentation. Notably, we don not use auto-augmentation

[42] for any of our models.

Table 2 compares EfﬁcientDet with other object de-

tectors, under the single-model single-scale settings with

no test-time augmentation.

We report accuracy for both

test-dev (20K test images with no public ground-truth)

and val (5K validation images with ground-truth). Our

EfﬁcientDet achieves better efﬁciency than previous detec-

tors, being 4x – 9x smaller and using 13x - 42x less FLOPs

across a wide range of accuracy or resource constraints.

On relatively low-accuracy regime, our EfﬁcientDet-D0

achieves similar accuracy as YOLOv3 with 28x fewer

FLOPs.

Compared to RetinaNet [21] and Mask-RCNN

[11], our EfﬁcientDet-D1 achieves similar accuracy with up

to 8x fewer parameters and 21x fewer FLOPs. On high-

accuracy regime, our EfﬁcientDet also consistently outper-

Input image resolution –

Since feature level 3-7 are used

in BiFPN, the input resolution must be dividable by 27 =

128, so we linearly increase resolutions using equation:

Rinput = 512 + φ · 128

(3)

Following Equations 1,2,3 with different φ, we have devel-

oped EfﬁcientDet-D0 (φ = 0) to D7 (φ = 7) as shown

in Table 1, where D7 is the same as D6 except higher res-

olution. Notably, our scaling is heuristic-based and might

not be optimal, but we will show that this simple scal-

ing method can signiﬁcantly improve efﬁciency than other

single-dimension scaling method in Figure 6.

(e.g., change anchors from 3x3 to 9x9, train with model

EfﬁcientDet models use the same 3x3 anchors and trained

without model parallelism.

5.2. EfﬁcientDet for Semantic Segmentation

In addition to parameter size and FLOPs, we have

also compared the real-world latency on Titan-V GPU and

single-thread Xeon CPU. We run each model 10 times with

batch size 1 and report the mean and standard deviation.

Figure 4 illustrates the comparison on model size, GPU la-

tency, and single-thread CPU latency. For fair comparison,

these ﬁgures only include results that are measured on the

same machine with the same settings. Compared to previ-

ous detectors, EfﬁcientDet models are up to 3.2x faster on

GPU and 8.1x faster on CPU, suggesting they are also efﬁ-

cient on real-world hardware.


---
*Page 6*


While our EfﬁcientDet models are mainly designed for

object detection, we are also interested in their performance

on other tasks such as semantic segmentation. Following

[16], we modify our EfﬁcientDet model to keep feature

level {P2, P3, ..., P7} in BiFPN, but only use P2 for the

ﬁnal per-pixel classiﬁcation. For simplicity, here we only

evaluate a EfﬁcientDet-D4 based model, which uses a Ima-

geNet pretrained EfﬁcientNet-B4 backbone (similar size to

ResNet-50). We set the channel size to 128 for BiFPN and

256 for classiﬁcation head. Both BiFPN and classiﬁcation

head are repeated by 3 times.

Notably, we exclude those results with ensemble, test-

Under the

same single-model single-scale settings, our model achieves

1.7% better accuracy with 9.8x fewer FLOPs than the prior

art of DeepLabV3+ [4]. These results suggest that Efﬁcient-

Det is also quite promising for semantic segmentation.

In this section, we ablate various design choices for our

proposed EfﬁcientDet. For simplicity, all accuracy results

here are for COCO validation set.

class/box prediction network, and the same training settings

for all experiments. As we can see, the conventional top-

down FPN is inherently limited by the one-way informa-

tion ﬂow and thus has the lowest accuracy. While repeated

FPN+PANet achieves slightly better accuracy than NAS-

FPN [8], it also requires more parameters and FLOPs. Our

BiFPN achieves similar accuracy as repeated FPN+PANet,

but uses much less parameters and FLOPs. With the addi-

tional weighted feature fusion, our BiFPN further achieves

the best accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPs.


---
*Page 7*


Since EfﬁcientDet uses both a powerful backbone and a

new BiFPN, we want to understand how much each of them

contributes to the accuracy and efﬁciency improvements.

Table 4 compares the impact of backbone and BiFPN. Start-

ing from a RetinaNet detector [21] with ResNet-50 [12]

backbone and top-down FPN [20], we ﬁrst replace the

backbone with EfﬁcientNet-B3, which improves accuracy

by about 3 AP with slightly less parameters and FLOPs.

By further replacing FPN with our proposed BiFPN, we

achieve additional 4 AP gain with much fewer parameters

and FLOPs. These results suggest that EfﬁcientNet back-

bones and BiFPN are both crucial for our ﬁnal models.

Table 5 shows the accuracy and model complexity for

Notably, the original FPN [20] and

PANet [23] only have one top-down or bottom-up ﬂow, but

for fair comparison, here we repeat each of them multiple

times and replace all convs with depthwise separable convs,

which is the same as BiFPN. We use the same backbone and

As discussed in Section 3.3, we propose a fast normal-

ized feature fusion approach to get ride of the expensive

softmax while retaining the beneﬁts of normalized weights.

Table 6 compares the softmax and fast normalized fusion

approaches in three detectors with different model sizes. As

shown in the results, our fast normalized fusion approach

achieves similar accuracy as the softmax-based fusion, but

runs 1.26x - 1.31x faster on GPUs.

In order to further understand the behavior of softmax-

lected from the BiFPN layers in EfﬁcientDet-D3. Notably,

7. Conclusion

In this paper, we systematically study network architec-

ture design choices for efﬁcient object detection, and pro-

pose a weighted bidirectional feature network and a cus-

tomized compound scaling method, in order to improve ac-

curacy and efﬁciency. Based on these optimizations, we de-

velop a new family of detectors, named EfﬁcientDet, which

consistently achieve better accuracy and efﬁciency than the

prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In

particular, our scaled EfﬁcientDet achieves state-of-the-art

accuracy with much fewer parameters and FLOPs than pre-

vious object detection and semantic segmentation models.

j wj) for fast normalized fu-

sion) always sum up to 1 for all inputs. Interestingly, the

normalized weights change rapidly during training, sug-

gesting different features contribute to the feature fusion

unequally. Despite the rapid change, our fast normalized

fusion approach always shows very similar learning behav-

ior to the softmax-based fusion for all three nodes.

6.4. Compound Scaling

As discussed in section 4.2, we employ a compound

scaling method to jointly scale up all dimensions of

depth/width/resolution for backbone, BiFPN, and box/class

prediction networks.

Figure 6 compares our compound

scaling with other alternative methods that scale up a sin-

gle dimension of resolution/depth/width. Although start-

ing from the same baseline detector, our compound scaling
