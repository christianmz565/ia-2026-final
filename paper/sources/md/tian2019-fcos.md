Abstract

We propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detec-

tor (FCOS) to solve object detection in a per-pixel predic-

tion fashion, analogue to semantic segmentation. Almost

all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD,

YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-deﬁned anchor

boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor

box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-

deﬁned set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the

complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as

calculating overlapping during training. More importantly,

we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes,

which are often very sensitive to the ﬁnal detection perfor-

mance. With the only post-processing non-maximum sup-

pression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves

44.7% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing,

surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage

of being much simpler. For the ﬁrst time, we demonstrate

a much simpler and ﬂexible detection framework achieving

improved detection accuracy. We hope that the proposed

FCOS framework can serve as a simple and strong alterna-

tive for many other instance-level tasks. Code is available

dicting a 4D vector (l, t, r, b) encoding the location of a bound-

ing box at each foreground pixel (supervised by ground-truth

bounding box information during training). The right plot shows

that when a location residing in multiple bounding boxes, it

can be ambiguous in terms of which bounding box this location

should regress.

mark [16]. As a result, these hyper-parameters need to be

carefully tuned in anchor-based detectors.

2) Even with

careful design, because the scales and aspect ratios of an-

chor boxes are kept ﬁxed, detectors encounter difﬁculties to

deal with object candidates with large shape variations, par-

ticularly for small objects. The pre-deﬁned anchor boxes

also hamper the generalization ability of detectors, as they

need to be re-designed on new detection tasks with differ-

ent object sizes or aspect ratios.

3) In order to achieve

a high recall rate, an anchor-based detector is required to

densely place anchor boxes on the input image (e.g., more

than 180K anchor boxes in feature pyramid networks (FPN)

[14] for an image with its shorter side being 800). Most

of these anchor boxes are labelled as negative samples dur-

ing training. The excessive number of negative samples ag-

gravates the imbalance between positive and negative sam-

ples in training. 4) Anchor boxes also involve complicated

computation such as calculating the intersection-over-union

(IoU) scores with ground-truth bounding boxes.

1. Introduction

Object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in

computer vision, which requires the algorithm to predict a

bounding box with a category label for each instance of in-

terest in an image. All current mainstream detectors such

as Faster R-CNN [24], SSD [18] and YOLOv2, v3 [23] rely

on a set of pre-deﬁned anchor boxes and it has long been

believed that the use of anchor boxes is the key to detectors’

success. Despite their great success, it is important to note

that anchor-based detectors suffer some drawbacks: 1) As

shown in [15, 24], detection performance is sensitive to the

sizes, aspect ratios and number of anchor boxes. For exam-

ple, in RetinaNet [15], varying these hyper-parameters af-

fects the performance up to 4% in AP on the COCO bench-

Recently, fully convolutional networks (FCNs) [20] have

achieved tremendous success in dense prediction tasks such

as semantic segmentation [20, 28, 9, 19], depth estimation

[17, 31], keypoint detection [3] and counting [2]. As one

of high-level vision tasks, object detection might be the

only one deviating from the neat fully convolutional per-

pixel prediction framework mainly due to the use of anchor

boxes. It is nature to ask a question: Can we solve object

detection in the neat per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue

to FCN for semantic segmentation, for example?

Thus

those fundamental vision tasks can be uniﬁed in (almost)

one single framework. We show that the answer is afﬁr-

mative. Moreover, we demonstrate that, for the ﬁrst time,

the much simpler FCN-based detector achieves even better

performance than its anchor-based counterparts.

• Detection is now uniﬁed with many other FCN-

solvable tasks such as semantic segmentation, making

it easier to re-use ideas from those tasks.

• Detection becomes proposal free and anchor free,

which signiﬁcantly reduces the number of design pa-

rameters. The design parameters typically need heuris-

tic tuning and many tricks are involved in order to

achieve good performance.

Therefore, our new de-

tection framework makes the detector, particularly its

training, considerably simpler.

• By eliminating the anchor boxes, our new detector

completely avoids the complicated computation re-

lated to anchor boxes such as the IOU computation and

matching between the anchor boxes and ground-truth

boxes during training, resulting in faster training and

testing as well as less training memory footprint than

its anchor-based counterpart.

• Without bells and whistles, we achieve state-of-the-

art results among one-stage detectors. We also show

that the proposed FCOS can be used as a Region

Proposal Networks (RPNs) in two-stage detectors and

can achieve signiﬁcantly better performance than its

anchor-based RPN counterparts. Given the even better

performance of the much simpler anchor-free detector,

we encourage the community to rethink the necessity of

anchor boxes in object detection, which are currently

considered as the de facto standard for detection.

• The proposed detector can be immediately extended

to solve other vision tasks with minimal modiﬁcation,

including instance segmentation and key-point detec-

tion. We believe that this new method can be the new

baseline for many instance-wise prediction problems.

*Page 2*


In the literature, some works attempted to leverage the

FCNs-based framework for object detection such as Dense-

Box [12]. Speciﬁcally, these FCN-based frameworks di-

rectly predict a 4D vector plus a class category at each spa-

tial location on a level of feature maps. As shown in Fig. 1

(left), the 4D vector depicts the relative offsets from the four

sides of a bounding box to the location. These frameworks

are similar to the FCNs for semantic segmentation, except

that each location is required to regress a 4D continuous

vector. However, to handle the bounding boxes with dif-

ferent sizes, DenseBox [12] crops and resizes training im-

ages to a ﬁxed scale. Thus DenseBox has to perform detec-

tion on image pyramids, which is against FCN’s philosophy

of computing all convolutions once. Besides, more signif-

icantly, these methods are mainly used in special domain

objection detection such as scene text detection [33, 10] or

face detection [32, 12], since it is believed that these meth-

ods do not work well when applied to generic object de-

tection with highly overlapped bounding boxes. As shown

in Fig. 1 (right), the highly overlapped bounding boxes re-

sult in an intractable ambiguity: it is not clear w.r.t. which

bounding box to regress for the pixels in the overlapped re-

gions.

2. Related Work

In the sequel, we take a closer look at the issue and show

that with FPN this ambiguity can be largely eliminated. As

a result, our method can already obtain comparable detec-

tion accuracy with those traditional anchor based detectors.

Furthermore, we observe that our method may produce a

number of low-quality predicted bounding boxes at the lo-

cations that are far from the center of an target object. In

order to suppress these low-quality detections, we intro-

duce a novel “center-ness” branch (only one layer) to pre-

dict the deviation of a pixel to the center of its correspond-

ing bounding box, as deﬁned in Eq. (3). This score is then

used to down-weight low-quality detected bounding boxes

and merge the detection results in NMS. The simple yet ef-

fective center-ness branch allows the FCN-based detector

to outperform anchor-based counterparts under exactly the

same training and testing settings.

Anchor-based Detectors.

Anchor-based detectors inherit

the ideas from traditional sliding-window and proposal

based detectors such as Fast R-CNN [6]. In anchor-based

detectors, the anchor boxes can be viewed as pre-deﬁned

sliding windows or proposals, which are classiﬁed as pos-

itive or negative patches, with an extra offsets regression

to reﬁne the prediction of bounding box locations. There-

fore, the anchor boxes in these detectors may be viewed

as training samples.

Unlike previous detectors like Fast

RCNN, which compute image features for each sliding win-

dow/proposal repeatedly, anchor boxes make use of the fea-

ture maps of CNNs and avoid repeated feature computation,

speeding up detection process dramatically. The design of

anchor boxes are popularized by Faster R-CNN in its RPNs

[24], SSD [18] and YOLOv2 [22], and has become the con-

vention in a modern detector.

This new detection framework enjoys the following ad-

vantages.

to be carefully tuned in order to achieve good perfor-

mance. Besides the above hyper-parameters describing an-

chor shapes, the anchor-based detectors also need other

hyper-parameters to label each anchor box as a positive,

ignored or negative sample. In previous works, they of-

ten employ intersection over union (IOU) between anchor

boxes and ground-truth boxes to determine the label of an

anchor box (e.g., a positive anchor if its IOU is in [0.5, 1]).

These hyper-parameters have shown a great impact on the

ﬁnal accuracy, and require heuristic tuning.

Meanwhile,

these hyper-parameters are speciﬁc to detection tasks, mak-

ing detection tasks deviate from a neat fully convolutional

network architectures used in other dense prediction tasks

such as semantic segmentation.

free detector, which detects a pair of corners of a bound-

ing box and groups them to form the ﬁnal detected bound-

ing box. CornerNet requires much more complicated post-

processing to group the pairs of corners belonging to the

same instance. An extra distance metric is learned for the

purpose of grouping.

Another family of anchor-free detectors such as [32] are

based on DenseBox [12]. The family of detectors have been

considered unsuitable for generic object detection due to

difﬁculty in handling overlapping bounding boxes and the

recall being relatively low. In this work, we show that both

problems can be largely alleviated with multi-level FPN

prediction. Moreover, we also show together with our pro-

posed center-ness branch, the much simpler detector can

achieve even better detection performance than its anchor-

based counterparts.

Anchor-free Detectors.

The most popular anchor-free

detector might be YOLOv1 [21]. Instead of using anchor

boxes, YOLOv1 predicts bounding boxes at points near

the center of objects. Only the points near the center are

used since they are considered to be able to produce higher-

quality detection. However, since only points near the cen-

ter are used to predict bounding boxes, YOLOv1 suffers

from low recall as mentioned in YOLOv2 [22]. As a result,

YOLOv2 [22] employs anchor boxes as well. Compared to

YOLOv1, FCOS takes advantages of all points in a ground

truth bounding box to predict the bounding boxes and the

low-quality detected bounding boxes are suppressed by the

proposed “center-ness” branch. As a result, FCOS is able to

provide comparable recall with anchor-based detectors as

shown in our experiments.

3. Our Approach

In this section, we ﬁrst reformulate object detection in

a per-pixel prediction fashion.

Next, we show that how

we make use of multi-level prediction to improve the re-

call and resolve the ambiguity resulted from overlapped

bounding boxes. Finally, we present our proposed “center-

ness” branch, which helps suppress the low-quality detected

bounding boxes and improves the overall performance by a

large margin.

siﬁcation and regression branches. Moreover, since the re-

gression targets are always positive, we employ exp(x) to

map any real number to (0, ∞) on the top of the regression

branch. It is worth noting that FCOS has 9× fewer network

output variables than the popular anchor-based detectors

[15, 24] with 9 anchor boxes per location.

For each location (x, y) on the feature map Fi, we can

map it back onto the input image as (⌊s

which is near the center of the receptive ﬁeld of the location

(x, y). Different from anchor-based detectors, which con-

sider the location on the input image as the center of (multi-

ple) anchor boxes and regress the target bounding box with

these anchor boxes as references, we directly regress the tar-

get bounding box at the location. In other words, our detec-

tor directly views locations as training samples instead of

anchor boxes in anchor-based detectors, which is the same

as FCNs for semantic segmentation [20].

Speciﬁcally, location (x, y) is considered as a positive

sample if it falls into any ground-truth box and the class la-

bel c∗of the location is the class label of the ground-truth

box. Otherwise it is a negative sample and c∗= 0 (back-

ground class). Besides the label for classiﬁcation, we also

have a 4D real vector t∗= (l∗, t∗, r∗, b∗) being the regres-

sion targets for the location. Here l∗, t∗, r∗and b∗are the

distances from the location to the four sides of the bound-

ing box, as shown in Fig. 1 (left). If a location falls into

multiple bounding boxes, it is considered as an ambiguous

sample. We simply choose the bounding box with minimal

area as its regression target. In the next section, we will

show that with multi-level prediction, the number of am-

biguous samples can be reduced signiﬁcantly and thus they

hardly affect the detection performance. Formally, if loca-

tion (x, y) is associated to a bounding box Bi, the training

regression targets for the location can be formulated as,

where Lcls is focal loss as in [15] and Lreg is the IOU loss

as in UnitBox [32]. Npos denotes the number of positive

samples and λ being 1 in this paper is the balance weight

for Lreg. The summation is calculated over all locations

on the feature maps Fi. 1{c∗

Inference.

The inference of FCOS is straightforward.

Given an input images, we forward it through the network

and obtain the classiﬁcation scores px,y and the regression

prediction tx,y for each location on the feature maps Fi.

Following [15], we choose the location with px,y > 0.05 as

positive samples and invert Eq. (1) to obtain the predicted

bounding boxes.

3.2. Multi-level Prediction with FPN for FCOS

Here we show that how two possible issues of the pro-

posed FCOS can be resolved with multi-level prediction

with FPN [14]. 1) The large stride (e.g., 16×) of the ﬁnal

feature maps in a CNN can result in a relatively low best

possible recall (BPR)1. For anchor based detectors, low re-

call rates due to the large stride can be compensated to some

extent by lowering the required IOU scores for positive an-

chor boxes. For FCOS, at the ﬁrst glance one may think that

the BPR can be much lower than anchor-based detectors

because it is impossible to recall an object which no loca-

tion on the ﬁnal feature maps encodes due to a large stride.

Here, we empirically show that even with a large stride,

FCN-based FCOS is still able to produce a good BPR, and

it can even better than the BPR of the anchor-based detec-

tor RetinaNet [15] in the ofﬁcial implementation Detectron

[7] (refer to Table 1). Therefore, the BPR is actually not

a problem of FCOS. Moreover, with multi-level FPN pre-

diction [14], the BPR can be improved further to match the

(1)

It is worth noting that FCOS can leverage as many fore-

ground samples as possible to train the regressor. It is dif-

ferent from anchor-based detectors, which only consider the

anchor boxes with a highly enough IOU with ground-truth

boxes as positive samples. We argue that it may be one of

the reasons that FCOS outperforms its anchor-based coun-

terparts.

Network Outputs.

Corresponding to the training targets,

the ﬁnal layer of our networks predicts an 80D vector p of

classiﬁcation labels and a 4D vector t = (l, t, r, b) bound-

ing box coordinates. Following [15], instead of training a

multi-class classiﬁer, we train C binary classiﬁers. Simi-

lar to [15], we add four convolutional layers after the fea-

ture maps of the backbone networks respectively for clas-

best BPR the anchor-based RetinaNet can achieve. 2) Over-

laps in ground-truth boxes can cause intractable ambiguity

, i.e., which bounding box should a location in the overlap

regress? This ambiguity results in degraded performance of

FCN-based detectors. In this work, we show that the am-

biguity can be greatly resolved with multi-level prediction,

and the FCN-based detector can obtain on par, sometimes

even better, performance compared with anchor-based ones.

*Page 5*


3.3. Center-ness for FCOS

After using multi-level prediction in FCOS, there is still

a performance gap between FCOS and anchor-based detec-

tors. We observed that it is due to a lot of low-quality pre-

dicted bounding boxes produced by locations far away from

the center of an object.

We propose a simple yet effective strategy to suppress

these low-quality detected bounding boxes without intro-

ducing any hyper-parameters. Speciﬁcally, we add a single-

layer branch, in parallel with the classiﬁcation branch (as

shown in Fig. 2) to predict the “center-ness” of a location2.

The center-ness depicts the normalized distance from the

location to the center of the object that the location is re-

sponsible for, as shown Fig. 7. Given the regression targets

l∗, t∗, r∗and b∗for a location, the center-ness target is de-

ﬁned as,


---
*Page 5*


Following FPN [14], we detect different sizes of ob-

jects on different levels of feature maps.

Speciﬁcally,

we make use of ﬁve levels of feature maps deﬁned as

{P3, P4, P5, P6, P7}. P3, P4 and P5 are produced by the

backbone CNNs’ feature maps C3, C4 and C5 followed by

a 1 × 1 convolutional layer with the top-down connections

in [14], as shown in Fig. 2. P6 and P7 are produced by ap-

plying one convolutional layer with the stride being 2 on P5

and P6, respectively. As a result, the feature levels P3, P4,

P5, P6 and P7 have strides 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128, respec-

tively.

(3)

Unlike anchor-based detectors, which assign anchor

boxes with different sizes to different feature levels, we di-

rectly limit the range of bounding box regression for each

level. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrstly compute the regression

targets l∗, t∗, r∗and b∗for each location on all feature lev-

els. Next, if a location satisﬁes max(l∗, t∗, r∗, b∗) > mi

or max(l∗, t∗, r∗, b∗) < mi−1, it is set as a negative sam-

ple and is thus not required to regress a bounding box any-

more. Here mi is the maximum distance that feature level

i needs to regress. In this work, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6 and

m7 are set as 0, 64, 128, 256, 512 and ∞, respectively.

Since objects with different sizes are assigned to different

feature levels and most overlapping happens between ob-

jects with considerably different sizes. If a location, even

with multi-level prediction used, is still assigned to more

than one ground-truth boxes, we simply choose the ground-

truth box with minimal area as its target. As shown in our

experiments, the multi-level prediction can largely alleviate

the aforementioned ambiguity and improve the FCN-based

detector to the same level of anchor-based ones.


---
*Page 5*


We employ sqrt here to slow down the decay of the center-

ness. The center-ness ranges from 0 to 1 and is thus trained

with binary cross entropy (BCE) loss. The loss is added to

the loss function Eq. (2). When testing, the ﬁnal score (used

for ranking the detected bounding boxes) is computed by

multiplying the predicted center-ness with the correspond-

ing classiﬁcation score. Thus the center-ness can down-

weight the scores of bounding boxes far from the center

of an object. As a result, with high probability, these low-

quality bounding boxes might be ﬁltered out by the ﬁnal

non-maximum suppression (NMS) process, improving the

detection performance remarkably.

An alternative of the center-ness is to make use of only

the central portion of ground-truth bounding box as posi-

tive samples with the price of one extra hyper-parameter,

as shown in works [12, 33]. After our submission, it has

been shown in [1] that the combination of both methods

can achieve a much better performance. The experimental

results can be found in Table 3.

Finally, following [14, 15], we share the heads be-

tween different feature levels, not only making the detector

parameter-efﬁcient but also improving the detection perfor-

mance. However, we observe that different feature levels

are required to regress different size range (e.g., the size

range is [0, 64] for P3 and [64, 128] for P4), and therefore it

is not reasonable to make use of identical heads for differ-

ent feature levels. As a result, instead of using the standard

exp(x), we make use of exp(six) with a trainable scalar si

to automatically adjust the base of the exponential function

for feature level Pi, which slightly improves the detection

performance.

*Page 5*


Our experiments are conducted on the large-scale detec-

tion benchmark COCO [16]. Following the common prac-

tice [15, 14, 24], we use the COCO trainval35k split

(115K images) for training and minival split (5K images)

as validation for our ablation study. We report our main re-

sults on the test dev split (20K images) by uploading our

detection results to the evaluation server.

2After the initial submission, it has been shown that the AP on MS-

COCO can be improved if the center-ness is parallel with the regression

branch instead of the classiﬁcation branch. However, unless speciﬁed, we

still use the conﬁguration in Fig. 2.

Figure 3 – Center-ness. Red, blue, and other colors denote 1, 0

and the values between them, respectively. Center-ness is com-

puted by Eq. (3) and decays from 1 to 0 as the location deviates

from the center of the object. When testing, the center-ness pre-

dicted by the network is multiplied with the classiﬁcation score

thus can down-weight the low-quality bounding boxes predicted

by a location far from the center of an object.

Training Details.

Unless speciﬁed, ResNet-50 [8] is used

as our backbone networks and the same hyper-parameters

with RetinaNet [15] are used. Speciﬁcally, our network is

trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for 90K it-

erations with the initial learning rate being 0.01 and a mini-

batch of 16 images. The learning rate is reduced by a factor

of 10 at iteration 60K and 80K, respectively. Weight de-

cay and momentum are set as 0.0001 and 0.9, respectively.

We initialize our backbone networks with the weights pre-

trained on ImageNet [4]. For the newly added layers, we

initialize them as in [15]. Unless speciﬁed, the input im-

ages are resized to have their shorter side being 800 and

their longer side less or equal to 1333.

with multi-level prediction.

Best Possible Recalls.

The ﬁrst concern about the FCN-

based detector is that it might not provide a good best pos-

sible recall (BPR). In the section, we show that the con-

cern is not necessary. Here BPR is deﬁned as the ratio of

the number of ground-truth boxes a detector can recall at

the most divided by all ground-truth boxes. A ground-truth

box is considered being recalled if the box is assigned to

at least one sample (i.e., a location in FCOS or an anchor

box in anchor-based detectors) during training. As shown

in Table 1, only with feature level P4 with stride being 16

(i.e., no FPN), FCOS can already obtain a BPR of 95.55%.

The BPR is much higher than the BPR of 90.92% of the

anchor-based detector RetinaNet in the ofﬁcial implemen-

tation Detectron, where only the low-quality matches with

IOU ≥0.4 are used. With the help of FPN, FCOS can

achieve a BPR of 98.40%, which is very close to the best

BPR that the anchor-based detector can achieve by using all

low-quality matches. Due to the fact that the best recall of

current detectors are much lower than 90%, the small BPR

gap (less than 1%) between FCOS and the anchor-based de-

tector will not actually affect the performance of detector.

It is also conﬁrmed in Table 3, where FCOS achieves even

better AR than its anchor-based counterparts under the same

training and testing settings. Therefore, the concern about

low BPR may not be necessary.

Inference Details.

We ﬁrstly forward the input image

through the network and obtain the predicted bounding

boxes with a predicted class. Unless speciﬁed, the following

post-processing is exactly the same with RetinaNet [15] and

we directly make use of the same post-processing hyper-

parameters of RetinaNet. We use the same sizes of input

images as in training. We hypothesize that the performance

of our detector may be improved further if we carefully tune

the hyper-parameters.

As mentioned before, the major concerns of an FCN-based

detector are low recall rates and ambiguous samples re-

Table 3 – FCOS vs. RetinaNet on the minival split with ResNet-50-FPN as the backbone. Directly using the training and testing

settings of RetinaNet, our anchor-free FCOS achieves even better performance than anchor-based RetinaNet both in AP and AR. With

Group Normalization (GN) in heads and NMS threshold being 0.6, FCOS can achieve 37.1 in AP. After our submission, some almost

cost-free improvements have been made for FCOS and the performance has been improved by a large margin, as shown by the rows

below “Improvements”. “ctr. on reg.”: moving the center-ness branch to the regression branch. “ctr. sampling”: only sampling the

central portion of ground-truth boxes as positive samples. “GIoU”: penalizing the union area over the circumscribed rectangle’s area in

IoU Loss. “Normalization”: normalizing the regression targets in Eq. (1) with the strides of FPN levels. Refer to our code for details.

ous samples due to the overlapping in ground-truth bound-

ing boxes, as shown in Fig. 1 (right). In Table 2, we show

the ratios of the ambiguous samples to all positive samples

on minival split. As shown in the table, there are indeed a

large amount of ambiguous samples (23.16%) if FPN is not

used and only feature level P4 is used. However, with FPN,

the ratio can be signiﬁcantly reduced to only 7.14% since

most of overlapped objects are assigned to different feature

levels. Moreover, we argue that the ambiguous samples re-

sulted from overlapping between objects of the same cate-

gory do not matter. For instance, if object A and B with the

same class have overlap, no matter which object the loca-

tions in the overlap predict, the prediction is correct because

it is always matched with the same category. The missed ob-

ject can be predicted by the locations only belonging to it.

Therefore, we only count the ambiguous samples in over-

lap between bounding boxes with different categories. As

shown in Table 2, the multi-level prediction reduces the ra-

tio of ambiguous samples from 17.84% to 3.75%. In order

to further show that the overlapping in ground truth boxes is

not a problem of our FCN-based FCOS, we count that when

inferring how many detected bounding boxes come from

the ambiguous locations. We found that only 2.3% detected

bounding boxes are produced by the ambiguous locations.

By further only considering the overlap between different

categories, the ratio is reduced to 1.5%. Note that it does

not imply that there are 1.5% locations where FCOS cannot

work. As mentioned before, these locations are associated

with the ground-truth boxes with minimal area. Therefore,

these locations only take the risk of missing some larger ob-

jects. As shown in the following experiments, they do not

make our FCOS inferior to anchor-based detectors.

4.1.2

With or Without Center-ness

As mentioned before, we propose “center-ness” to suppress

the low-quality detected bounding boxes produced by the

locations far from the center of an object. As shown in

Table 4, the center-ness branch can boost AP from 33.5%

to 37.1%, making anchor-free FCOS outperform anchor-

based RetinaNet (35.9%).

Note that anchor-based Reti-

naNet employs two IoU thresholds to label anchor boxes as

positive/negative samples, which can also help to suppress

the low-quality predictions. The proposed center-ness can

eliminate the two hyper-parameters. However, after our ini-

tial submission, it has shown that using both center-ness and

the thresholds can result in a better performance, as shown

by the row “+ ctr. sampling” in Table 3. One may note

that center-ness can also be computed with the predicted

regression vector without introducing the extra center-ness

branch. However, as shown in Table 4, the center-ness com-

puted from the regression vector cannot improve the perfor-

mance and thus the separate center-ness is necessary.

4.2. Comparison with State-of-the-art Detectors

We compare FCOS with other state-of-the-art object de-

tectors on test −dev split of MS-COCO benchmark. For

these experiments, we randomly scale the shorter side of

images in the range from 640 to 800 during the training and

double the number of iterations to 180K (with the learn-

ing rate change points scaled proportionally). Other set-

tings are exactly the same as the model with AP 37.1% in

Table 3. As shown in Table 5, with ResNet-101-FPN, our

FCOS outperforms the RetinaNet with the same backbone

ResNet-101-FPN by 2.4% in AP. To our knowledge, it is

the ﬁrst time that an anchor-free detector, without any bells

and whistles outperforms anchor-based detectors by a large

margin. FCOS also outperforms other classical two-stage

anchor-based detectors such as Faster R-CNN by a large

margin. With ResNeXt-64x4d-101-FPN [30] as the back-

bone, FCOS achieves 43.2% in AP. It outperforms the re-

cent state-of-the-art anchor-free detector CornerNet [13] by

a large margin while being much simpler. Note that Cor-

nerNet requires to group corners with embedding vectors,

which needs special design for the detector. Thus, we ar-

gue that FCOS is more likely to serve as a strong and sim-

ple alternative to current mainstream anchor-based detec-

tors. Moreover, FCOS with the improvements in Table 3

achieves 44.7% in AP with single-model and single scale

testing, which surpasses previous detectors by a large mar-

gin.

(GN) [29] in the newly added convolutional layers except

for the last prediction layers, which makes our training more

stable. 2) We use P5 to produce the P6 and P7 instead of

C5 in the standard RetinaNet. We observe that using P5 can

improve the performance slightly.

To show that our FCOS can serve as an simple and strong

alternative of anchor-based detectors, and for a fair compar-

ison, we remove GN (the gradients are clipped to prevent

them from exploding) and use C5 in our detector. As shown

in Table 3, with exactly the same settings, our FCOS still

compares favorably with the anchor-based detector (36.3%

vs 35.9%). Moreover, it is worth to note that we directly use

all hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rate, the NMS threshold

and etc.) from RetinaNet, which have been optimized for

the anchor-based detector. We argue that the performance

of FCOS can be improved further if the hyper-parameters

are tuned for it.

It is worth noting that with some almost cost-free im-

provements, as shown in Table 3, the performance of

our anchor-free detector can be improved by a large mar-

gin. Given the superior performance and the merits of the

anchor-free detector (e.g., much simpler and fewer hyper-

parameters than anchor-based detectors), we encourage the

community to rethink the necessity of anchor boxes in ob-

ject detection.

5. Extensions on Region Proposal Networks

So far we have shown that in a one-stage detector, our

FCOS can achieve even better performance than anchor-

based counterparts. Intuitively, FCOS should be also able

to replace the anchor boxes in Region Proposal Networks

(RPNs) with FPN [14] in the two-stage detector Faster R-

CNN. Here, we conﬁrm that by experiments.

Compared to RPNs with FPN [14], we replace anchor

boxes with the method in FCOS. Moreover, we add GN into

the layers in FPN heads, which can make our training more

stable. All other settings are exactly the same with RPNs

with FPN in the ofﬁcial code [7]. As shown in Table 6, even

without the proposed center-ness branch, our FCOS already

improves both AR100 and AR1k signiﬁcantly. With the pro-

posed center-ness branch, FCOS further boosts AR100 and

AR1k respectively to 52.8% and 60.3%, which are 18% rel-

ative improvement for AR100 and 3.4% absolute improve-

ment for AR1k over the RPNs with FPN.

We have proposed an anchor-free and proposal-free one-

stage detector FCOS. As shown in experiments, FCOS

compares favourably against the popular anchor-based one-

stage detectors, including RetinaNet, YOLO and SSD,

but with much less design complexity. FCOS completely

avoids all computation and hyper-parameters related to an-

chor boxes and solves the object detection in a per-pixel pre-

diction fashion, similar to other dense prediction tasks such

as semantic segmentation. FCOS also achieves state-of-the-

art performance among one-stage detectors. We also show

that FCOS can be used as RPNs in the two-stage detector

Faster R-CNN and outperforms the its RPNs by a large mar-

gin. Given its effectiveness and efﬁciency, we hope that

FCOS can serve as a strong and simple alternative of cur-

rent mainstream anchor-based detectors. We also believe

that FCOS can be extended to solve many other instance-

level recognition tasks.

being 0.50, 0.75 and 0.90, respectively. Table 7 shows APs

corresponding to the three curves.

As shown in Table 7, our FCOS achieves better perfor-

mance than its anchor-based counterpart RetinaNet. More-

over, it worth noting that with a stricter IOU threshold,

FCOS enjoys a larger improvement over RetinaNet, which

suggests that FCOS has a better bounding box regressor to

detect objects more accurately. One of the reasons should

be that FCOS has the ability to leverage more foreground

samples to train the regressor as mentioned in our main pa-

per.

Finally, as shown in all precision-recall curves, the best

recalls of these detectors in the precision-recall curves are

much lower than 90%. It further suggests that the small gap

(98.40% vs. 99.23%) of best possible recall (BPR) between

FCOS and RetinaNet hardly harms the ﬁnal detection per-

formance.

As mentioned in our main paper, by suppressing low-

quality detected bounding boxes, the proposed center-ness

branch improves the detection performance by a large mar-

gin. In this section, we conﬁrm this.

We expect that the center-ness can down-weight the

scores of low-quality bounding boxes such that these

bounding boxes can be ﬁltered out in following post-

processing such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). A

detected bounding box is considered as a low-quality one if

it has a low IOU score with its corresponding ground-truth

bounding box. A bounding box with low IOU but a high

conﬁdence score is likely to become a false positive and

harm the precision.

Moreover, the improvement over RetinaNet becomes larger with

10. More discussions

Center-ness vs. IoUNet:

Center-ness and IoUNet of Jiang et al. “Acquisition of

Localization Conﬁdence for Accurate Object Detection”

shares a similar purpose (i.e., to suppress low-quality pre-

dictions) with different approaches. IoUNet trains a sep-

arate network to predict the IoU score between predicted

bounding-boxes and ground-truth boxes. Center-ness, as a

part of our detector, only has a single layer and is trained

jointly with the detector, thus being much simpler. More-

over, “center-ness” does not take as input the predicted

bounding-boxes. Instead, it directly accesses the location’s

ability to predict high-quality bounding-boxes.

We do not aim to compare “recall by speciﬁc IoU” with

“recall by pixel within box”. The main purpose of Table 1

is to show that the upper bound of recall of FCOS is very

close to the upper bound of recall of anchor-based Reti-

naNet (98.4% vs. 99.23%). BPR by other IoU thresholds

are listed as those are used in the ofﬁcial code of RetinaNet.

Moreover, no evidence shows that the regression targets of

FCOS are difﬁcult to learn because they are more spread-

out. FCOS in fact yields more accurate bounding-boxes.

During training, we deal with the ambiguity at the same

FPN level by choosing the ground-truth box with the min-

imal area. When testing, if two objects A and B with the

same class have overlap, no matter which one object the

locations in the overlap predict, the prediction is correct

and the missed one can be predicted by the locations only

belonging to it. In the case that A and B do not belong

to the same class, a location in the overlap might predict

A’s class but regress B’s bounding-box, which is a mistake.

That is why we only count the ambiguity across different

classes. Moreover, it appears that this ambiguity does not

make FCOS worse than RetinaNet in AP, as shown in Table

8.

Additional ablation study:

As shown in Table 8, a vanilla FCOS performs on par with

RetinaNet, being of simpler design and with ∼9× less net-

work outputs. Moreover, FCOS works much better than

RetinaNet with single anchor. As for the 2% gain on test-

dev, besides the performance gain brought by the compo-

nents in Table 8, we conjecture that different training details

(e.g., learning rate schedule) might cause slight differences

in performance.

its corresponding ground-truth box. As shown in Fig. 7

(left), before applying the center-ness, there are a large

number of low-quality bounding boxes but with a high con-

ﬁdence score (i.e., the points under the line y = x). Due

to their high scores, these low-quality bounding boxes can-

not be eliminated in post-processing and result in lowering

the precision of the detector. After multiplying the classi-

ﬁcation score with the center-ness score, these points are

pushed to the left side of the plot (i.e., their scores are re-

duced), as shown in Fig. 7 (right). As a result, these low-

quality bounding boxes are much more likely to be ﬁltered

out in post-processing and the ﬁnal detection performance

can be improved.

boxes (under the line y = x) are pushed to the left side of the plot. It suggests that the scores of these boxes are reduced substantially.

Center-ness cannot be directly used in RetinaNet with

multiple anchor boxes per location because one location on

feature maps has only one center-ness score but different

anchor boxes on the same location require different “center-

ness” (note that center-ness is also used as “soft” thresholds

for positive/negative samples).

For anchor-based RetinaNet, the IoU score between an-

chor boxes and ground-truth boxes may serve as an alterna-

tive of “center-ness”.

Positive samples overlap with RetinaNet:

We want to highlight that center-ness comes into play

only when testing.

When training, all locations within

ground-truth boxes are marked as positive samples. As a

result, FCOS can use more foreground locations to train the

regressor and thus yield more accurate bounding-boxes.
