Abstract


With the rapid increase of large-scale, real-world
datasets, it becomes critical to address the problem of long-
tailed data distribution (i.e., a few classes account for most
of the data, while most classes are under-represented). Ex-
isting solutions typically adopt class re-balancing strategies
such as re-sampling and re-weighting based on the number
of observations for each class. In this work, we argue that
as the number of samples increases, the additional beneﬁt
of a newly added data point will diminish. We introduce
a novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by
associating with each sample a small neighboring region
rather than a single point. The effective number of samples
is deﬁned as the volume of samples and can be calculated
by a simple formula (1−βn)/(1−β), where n is the number
of samples and β ∈[0, 1) is a hyperparameter. We design a
re-weighting scheme that uses the effective number of sam-
ples for each class to re-balance the loss, thereby yielding
a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive experiments are con-
ducted on artiﬁcially induced long-tailed CIFAR datasets
and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNatural-
ist. Our results show that when trained with the proposed
class-balanced loss, the network is able to achieve signiﬁ-
cant performance gains on long-tailed datasets.


1. Introduction


The recent success of deep Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) for visual recognition [25, 36, 37, 16] owes
much to the availability of large-scale, real-world anno-
tated datasets [7, 27, 48, 40]. In contrast with commonly
used visual recognition datasets (e.g., CIFAR [24, 39], Ima-
geNet ILSVRC 2012 [7, 33] and CUB-200 Birds [42]) that
exhibit roughly uniform distributions of class labels, real-
world datasets have skewed [21] distributions, with a long-
tail: a few dominant classes claim most of the examples,
while most of the other classes are represented by relatively
few examples. CNNs trained on such data perform poorly
for weakly represented classes [19, 15, 41, 4].

Figure 1. Two classes, one from the head and one from the tail of
a long-tailed dataset (iNaturalist 2017 [40] in this example), have
drastically different number of samples. Models trained on these
samples are biased toward dominant classes (black solid line). Re-
weighing the loss by inverse class frequency usually yields poor
performance (red dashed line) on real-world data with high class
imbalance. We propose a theoretical framework to quantify the
effective number of samples by taking data overlap into consider-
ation. A class-balanced term is designed to re-weight the loss by
inverse effective number of samples. We show in experiments that
the performance of a model can be improved when trained with
the proposed class-balanced loss (blue dashed line).


A number of recent studies have aimed to alleviate the
challenge of long-tailed training data [3, 31, 17, 41, 43, 12,
47, 44]. In general, there are two strategies: re-sampling
and cost-sensitive re-weighting. In re-sampling, the number
of examples is directly adjusted by over-sampling (adding
repetitive data) for the minor class or under-sampling (re-
moving data) for the major class, or both. In cost-sensitive
re-weighting, we inﬂuence the loss function by assigning

relatively higher costs to examples from minor classes. In
the context of deep feature representation learning using
CNNs, re-sampling may either introduce large amounts of
duplicated samples, which slows down the training and
makes the model susceptible to overﬁtting when over-
sampling, or discard valuable examples that are important
for feature learning when under-sampling. Due to these dis-
advantages of applying re-sampling for CNN training, the
present work focuses on re-weighting approaches, namely,
how to design a better class-balanced loss.


Typically, a class-balanced loss assigns sample weights
inversely proportionally to the class frequency. This simple
heuristic method has been widely adopted [17, 43]. How-
ever, recent work on training from large-scale, real-world,
long-tailed datasets [30, 28] reveals poor performance when
using this strategy. Instead, they use a “smoothed” version
of weights that are empirically set to be inversely propor-
tional to the square root of class frequency. These obser-
vations suggest an interesting question: how can we design
a better class-balanced loss that is applicable to a diverse
array of datasets?


We aim to answer this question from the perspective of
sample size. As illustrated in Figure 1, we consider training
a model to discriminate between a major class and a minor
class from a long-tailed dataset. Due to highly imbalanced
data, directly training the model or re-weighting the loss
by inverse number of samples cannot yield satisfactory per-
formance. Intuitively, the more data, the better. However,
since there is information overlap among data, as the num-
ber of samples increases, the marginal beneﬁt a model can
extract from the data diminishes. In light of this, we propose
a novel theoretical framework to characterize data overlap
and calculate the effective number of samples in a model-
and loss-agnostic manner. A class-balanced re-weighting
term that is inversely proportional to the effective number of
samples is added to the loss function. Extensive experimen-
tal results indicate that this class-balanced term provides a
signiﬁcant boost to the performance of commonly used loss
functions for training CNNs on long-tailed datasets.


Our key contributions can be summarized as follows: (1)
We provide a theoretical framework to study the effective
number of samples and show how to design a class-balanced
term to deal with long-tailed training data. (2) We show that
signiﬁcant performance improvements can be achieved by
adding the proposed class-balanced term to existing com-
monly used loss functions including softmax cross-entropy,
sigmoid cross-entropy and focal loss. In addition, we show
our class-balanced loss can be used as a generic loss for vi-
sual recognition by outperforming commonly-used softmax
cross-entropy loss on ILSVRC 2012. We believe our study
on quantifying the effective number of samples and class-
balanced loss can offer useful guidelines for researchers
working in domains with long-tailed class distributions.


2. Related Work


Most of previous efforts on long-tailed imbalanced data
can be divided into two regimes: re-sampling [35, 12, 4, 50]
(including over-sampling and under-sampling) and cost-
sensitive learning [38, 49, 17, 22, 34].


Re-Sampling.
Over-sampling adds repeated samples
from minor classes, which could cause the model to over-
ﬁt. To solve this, novel samples can be either interpolated
from neighboring samples [5] or synthesized [14, 50] for
minor classes. However, the model is still error-prone due to
noise in the novel samples. It was argued that even if over-
sampling incurs risks from removing important samples,
under-sampling is still preferred over over-sampling [9].


Cost-Sensitive Learning. Cost-Sensitive Learning can
be traced back to a classical method in statistics called im-
portance sampling [20], where weights are assigned to sam-
ples in order to match a given data distribution. Elkan et
al. [10] studied how to assign weights to adjust the decision
boundary to match a given target in the case of binary clas-
siﬁcation. For imbalanced datasets, weighting by inverse
class frequency [17, 43] or a smoothed version of inverse
square root of class frequency [30, 28] are often adopted.
As a generalization of smoothed weighting with a theoreti-
cally grounded framework, we focus on (a) how to quantify
the effective number of samples and (b) using it to re-weight
the loss. Another line of important work aims to study sam-
ple difﬁculty in terms of loss and assign higher weights to
hard examples [11, 29, 8, 26]. Samples from minor classes
tend to have higher losses than those from major classes
as the features learned in minor classes are usually poorer.
However, there is no direct connection between sample dif-
ﬁculty and the number of samples. A side effect of assign-
ing higher weights to hard examples is the focus on harmful
samples (e.g., noisy data or mislabeled data) [23, 32]. In
our work, we do not make any assumptions on the sam-
ple difﬁculty and data distribution. By improving the fo-
cal loss [26] using our class-balanced term in experiments,
we show that our method is complementary to re-weighting
based on sample difﬁculty.


It is noteworthy to mention that previous work has also
explored other ways of dealing with data imbalance, includ-
ing transferring the knowledge learned from major classes
to minor classes [3, 31, 43, 6, 44] and designing a better
training objective via metric learning [17, 47, 45].


Covering and Effective Sample Size.
Our theoreti-
cal framework is inspired by the random covering prob-
lem [18], where the goal is to cover a large set by a se-
quence of i.i.d. random small sets. We simplify the problem
in Section 3 by making reasonable assumptions. Note that
the effective number of samples proposed in this paper is
different from the concept of effective sample size in statis-
tics. The effective sample size is used to calculate variance
when samples are correlated.


3. Effective Number of Samples


We formulate the data sampling process as a simpliﬁed
version of random covering. The key idea is to associate
each sample with a small neighboring region instead of a
single point. We present our theoretical framework and the
formulation of calculating effective number of samples.


3.1. Data Sampling as Random Covering


Given a class, denote the set of all possible data in the
feature space of this class as S. We assume the volume of S
is N and N ≥1. Denote each data as a subset of S that has
the unit volume of 1 and may overlap with other data. Con-
sider the data sampling process as a random covering prob-
lem where each data (subset) is randomly sampled from S
to cover the entire set of S. The more data is being sampled,
the better the coverage of S is. The expected total volume
of sampled data increases as the number of data increases
and is bounded by N. Therefore, we deﬁne:


Deﬁnition 1 (Effective Number). The effective number of
samples is the expected volume of samples.


The calculation of the expected volume of samples is a
very difﬁcult problem that depends on the shape of the sam-
ple and the dimensionality of the feature space [18]. To
make the problem tamable, we simplify the problem by not
considering the situation of partial overlapping. That is, we
assume a newly sampled data can only interact with previ-
ously sampled data in two ways: either entirely inside the
set of previously sampled data with the probability of p or
entirely outside with the probability of 1−p, as illustrated in
Figure 2. As the number of sampled data points increases,
the probability p will be higher.


Before we dive into the mathematical formulations, we
discuss the connection between our deﬁnition of effective
number of samples and real-world visual data. Our idea is
to capture the diminishing marginal beneﬁts by using more
data points of a class. Due to intrinsic similarities among
real-world data, as the number of samples grows, it is highly
possible that a newly added sample is a near-duplicate of
existing samples. In addition, CNNs are trained with heavy
data augmentations, where simple transformations such as
random cropping, re-scaling and horizontal ﬂipping will be
applied to the input data. In this case, all augmented ex-
amples are also considered as same with the original exam-
ple. Presumably, the stronger the data augmentation is, the
smaller the N will be. The small neighboring region of a
sample is a way to capture all near-duplicates and instances
that can be obtained by data augmentation. For a class, N
can be viewed as the number of unique prototypes.


3.2. Mathematical Formulation


Denote the effective number (expected volume) of sam-
ples as En, where n ∈Z>0 is the number of samples.


All possible data (N)


Newly sampled data (1)


Previously sampled data


Overlapped (p)


Not overlapped (1-p)


Figure 2. Giving the set of all possible data with volume N and
the set of previously sampled data, a new sample with volume 1
has the probability of p being overlapped with previous data and
the probability of 1 −p not being overlapped.


Proposition 1 (Effective Number). En = (1−βn)/(1−β),
where β = (N −1)/N.


Proof. We prove the proposition by induction.
It is ob-
vious that E1 = 1 because there is no overlapping. So
E1 = (1−β1)/(1−β) = 1 holds. Now let’s consider a gen-
eral case where we have previously sampled n−1 examples
and are about to sample the nth example. Now the expected
volume of previously sampled data is En−1 and the newly
sampled data point has the probability of p = En−1/N to
be overlapped with previous samples. Therefore, the ex-
pected volume after sampling nth example is:


En = pEn−1+(1−p)(En−1+1) = 1+ N −1


N
En−1. (1)


Assume En−1 = (1 −βn−1)/(1 −β) holds, then


En = 1+β 1 −βn−1


1 −β
= 1 −β + β −βn


1 −β
= 1 −βn


1 −β . (2)


The above proposition shows that the effective number of
samples is an exponential function of n. The hyperparame-
ter β ∈[0, 1) controls how fast En grows as n increases.


Another explanation of the effective number En is:


En = (1 −βn)/(1 −β) =


n
X


j=1


βj−1.
(3)


This means that the jth sample contributes βj−1 to the ef-
fective number. The total volume N for all possible data in
the class can then be calculated as:


N = lim


n→∞


n
X


j=1


βj−1 = 1/(1 −β).
(4)


This is consistent with our deﬁnition of β in the proposition.


Implication 1 (Asymptotic Properties). En = 1 if β = 0
(N = 1). En →n as β →1 (N →∞).


Proof. If β = 0, then En = (1 −0n)/(1 −0) = 1. In the
case of β →1, denote f(β) = 1 −βn and g(β) = 1 −β.
Since limβ→1 f(β) = limβ→1 g(β) = 0, g′(β) = −1̸ = 0
and limβ→1 f ′(β)/g′(β) = limβ→1(−nβn−1)/(−1) = n
exists, using L’Hˆopital’s rule, we have


lim
β→1 En = lim


β→1


f(β)
g(β) = lim


β→1


f ′(β)
g′(β) = n.
(5)


The asymptotic property of En shows that when N is
large, the effective number of samples is same as the num-
ber of samples n. In this scenario, we think the number
of unique prototypes N is large, thus there is no data over-
lap and every sample is unique. On the other extreme, if
N = 1, this means that we believe there exist a single pro-
totype so that all the data in this class can be represented by
this prototype via data augmentation, transformations, etc.


4. Class-Balanced Loss


The Class-Balanced Loss is designed to address the
problem of training from imbalanced data by introducing
a weighting factor that is inversely proportional to the ef-
fective number of samples. The class-balanced loss term
can be applied to a wide range of deep networks and loss
functions.


For an input sample x with label y ∈{1, 2, . . . , C} 1,
where C is the total number of classes, suppose the model’s
estimated class probabilities are p = [p1, p2, . . . , pC]⊤,
where pi ∈[0, 1] ∀i, we denote the loss as L(p, y). Sup-
pose the number of samples for class i is ni, based on Equa-
tion 2, the proposed effective number of samples for class
i is Eni = (1 −βni


i )/(1 −βi), where βi = (Ni −1)/Ni.
Without further information of data for each class, it is dif-
ﬁcult to empirically ﬁnd a set of good hyperparameters Ni
for all classes. Therefore, in practice, we assume Ni is only
dataset-dependent and set Ni = N, βi = β = (N −1)/N
for all classes in a dataset.


To balance the loss, we introduce a weighting factor αi
that is inversely proportional to the effective number of sam-
ples for class i: αi ∝1/Eni. To make the total loss roughly
in the same scale when applying αi, we normalize αi so
that PC


i=1 αi = C. For simplicity, we abuse the notation of
1/Eni to denote the normalized weighting factor in the rest
of our paper.


Formally speaking, given a sample from class i that con-
tains ni samples in total, we propose to add a weighting


1For simplicity, we derive the loss function by assuming there is only
one ground-truth label for a sample.

where ny is the number of samples in the ground-truth class
y. We visualize class-balanced loss in Figure 3 as a func-
tion of ny for different β. Note that β = 0 corresponds to
no re-weighting and β →1 corresponds to re-weighing by
inverse class frequency. The proposed novel concept of ef-
fective number of samples enables us to use a hyperparame-
ter β to smoothly adjust the class-balanced term between no
re-weighting and re-weighing by inverse class frequency.


The proposed class-balanced term is model-agnostic and
loss-agnostic in the sense that it’s independent to the choice
of loss function L and predicted class probabilities p. To
demonstrate the proposed class-balanced loss is generic, we
show how to apply class-balanced term to three commonly
used loss functions: softmax cross-entropy loss, sigmoid
cross-entropy loss and focal loss.


4.1. Class-Balanced Softmax Cross-Entropy Loss


Suppose the predicted output from the model for all
classes are z = [z1, z2, . . . , zC]⊤, where C is the total num-
ber of classes.
The softmax function regards each class
as mutual exclusive and calculate the probability distribu-
tion over all classes as pi = exp(zi)/ PC


j=1 exp(zj), ∀i ∈
{1, 2, . . . , C}. Given a sample with class label y, the soft-
max cross-entropy (CE) loss for this sample is written as:


CEsoftmax(z, y) = −log


 


exp(zy)

(CB) softmax cross-entropy loss is:

. (8)


4.2. Class-Balanced Sigmoid Cross-Entropy Loss


Different from softmax, class-probabilities calculated by
sigmoid function assume each class is independent and not
mutually exclusive. When using sigmoid function, we re-
gard multi-class visual recognition as multiple binary clas-
siﬁcation tasks, where each output node of the network is
performing a one-vs-all classiﬁcation to predict the proba-
bility of the target class over the rest of classes. Compared
with softmax, sigmoid presumably has two advantages for
real-world datasets: (1) Sigmoid doesn’t assume the mutual
exclusiveness among classes, which aligns well with real-
world data, where a few classes might be very similar to
each other, especially in the case of large number of ﬁne-
grained classes. (2) Since each class is considered inde-
pendent and has its own predictor, sigmoid uniﬁes single-
label classiﬁcation with multi-label prediction. This is a
nice property to have since real-world data often has more
than one semantic label.


Using same notations as softmax cross-entropy, for sim-
plicity, we deﬁne zt


i as:


zt


i =

4.3. Class-Balanced Focal Loss


The recently proposed focal loss (FL) [26] adds a mod-
ulating factor to the sigmoid cross-entropy loss to reduce
the relative loss for well-classiﬁed samples and focus on
difﬁcult samples. Denote pt

The original focal loss has an α-balanced variant. The
class-balanced focal loss is same as α-balanced focal loss
when αt = (1−β)/(1−βny). Therefore, the class-balanced
term can be viewed as an explicit way to set αt in focal loss
based on the effective number of samples.


5. Experiments


The proposed class-balanced losses are evaluated on ar-
tiﬁcially created long-tailed CIFAR [24] datasets with con-
trollable degrees of data imbalance and real-world long-
tailed datasets iNaturalist 2017 [40] and 2018 [1].
To
demonstrate our loss is generic for visual recognition,
we also present experiments on ImageNet data (ILSVRC
2012 [33]). We use deep residual networks (ResNet) [16]
with various depths and train all networks from scratch.

tailed CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.


iNaturalist. The recently introduced iNaturalist species
classiﬁcation and detection dataset [40] is a real-world
long-tailed dataset containing 579,184 training images from
5,089 classes in its 2017 version and 437,513 training im-
ages from 8,142 classes in its 2018 version [1]. We use the
ofﬁcial training and validation splits in our experiments.


ImageNet. We use the ILSVRC 2012 [33] split contain-
ing 1,281,167 training and 50,000 validation images.


Table 1 summarizes all datasets used in our experiments
along with their imbalance factors.


5.2. Implementation


Training with sigmoid-based losses.
Conventional
training scheme of deep networks initializes the last linear
classiﬁcation layer with bias b = 0. As pointed out by Lin et
al. [26], this could cause instability of training when using
sigmoid function to get class probabilities. This is because
using b = 0 with sigmoid function in the last layer induces
huge loss at the beginning of the training as the output prob-
ability for each class is close to 0.5. Therefore, for training
with sigmoid cross-entropy loss and focal loss, we assume
the class prior is π = 1/C for each class, where C is the
number of classes, and initialize the bias of the last layer
as b = −log ((1 −π) /π). In addition, we remove the L2
regularization (weight decay) for the bias b of the last layer.


We used Tensorﬂow [2] to implement and train all the
models by stochastic gradient descent with momentum. We
trained residual networks with 32 layers (ResNet-32) to
conduct all experiments on CIFAR. Similar to Zagoruyko et


al. [46], we noticed a disturbing effect in training ResNets
on CIFAR that both loss and validation error gradually went
up after the learning rate drop, especially in the case of
high data imbalance. We found that setting learning rate
decay to 0.01 instead of 0.1 solved the problem. Models
on CIFAR were trained with batch size of 128 on a single
NVIDIA Titan X GPU for 200 epochs. The initial learn-
ing rate was set to 0.1, which was then decayed by 0.01
at 160 epochs and again at 180 epochs. We also used lin-
ear warm-up of learning rate [13] in the ﬁrst 5 epochs. On
iNaturalist and ILSVRC 2012 data, we followed the same
training strategy used by Goyal et al. [13] and trained resid-
ual networks with batch size of 1024 on a single cloud TPU.
Since the scale of focal loss is smaller than softmax and sig-
moid cross-entropy loss, when training with focal loss, we
used 2× and 4× larger learning rate on ILSVRC 2012 and
iNaturalist respectively. Code, data and pre-trained mod-
els are available at:

class-balanced-loss.


5.3. Visual Recognition on Long-Tailed CIFAR


We conduct extensive studies on long-tailed CIFAR
datasets with various imbalance factors.
Table 2 shows
the performance of ResNet-32 in terms of classiﬁcation
error rate on the test set.
We present results of using
softmax cross-entropy loss, sigmoid cross-entroy loss, fo-
cal loss with different γ, and the proposed class-balanced
loss with best hyperparameters chosen via cross-validation.
The search space of hyperparameters is {softmax, sigmoid,
focal} for loss type, β ∈{0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999} (Sec-
tion 4), and γ ∈{0.5, 1.0, 2.0} for focal loss [26].


From results in Table 2, we have the following observa-
tions: (1) With properly selected hyperparameters, class-
balanced loss is able to signiﬁcantly improve the perfor-
mance of commonly used loss functions on long-tailed
datasets. (2) Softmax cross-entropy is overwelmingly used
as the loss function for visual recognition tasks.

Figure 5. Classiﬁcation error rate when trained with and without the class-balanced term. On CIFAR-10, class-balanced loss yields
consistent improvement across different β and the larger the β is, the larger the improvement is. On CIFAR-100, β = 0.99 or β = 0.999
improves the original loss, whereas a larger β hurts the performance.

effective number of samples are similar across all classes.


ever, following the training strategy in Section 5.2, sigmoid
cross-entropy and focal loss are able to outperform soft-
max cross-entropy in most cases. (3) The best β is 0.9999
on CIFAR-10 unanimously. But on CIFAR-100, datasets
with different imbalance factors tend to have different and
smaller optimal β.


To understand the role of β and class-balanced loss bet-
ter, we use the long-tailed dataset with imbalance factor
of 50 as an example to show the error rate of the model
when trained with and without the class-balanced term
in Figure 5. Interestingly, for CIFAR-10, class-balanced
term always improves the performance of the original loss
and more performance gain can be obtained with larger β.
However, on CIFAR-100, only small values of β improve
the performance, whereas larger values degrade the perfor-
mance. Figure 6 illustrates the effective number of samples
under different β. On CIFAR-10, when re-weighting based
on β = 0.9999, the effective number of samples is close to
the number of samples. This means the best re-weighting
strategy on CIFAR-10 is similar with re-weighting by in-


verse class frequency.
On CIFAR-100, the poor perfor-
mance of using larger β suggests that re-weighting by in-
verse class frequency is not a wise choice. Instead, we need
to use a smaller β that has smoother weights across classes.
This is reasonable because β = (N −1)/N, so larger β
means larger N. As discussed in Section 3, N can be inter-
preted as the number of unique prototypes. A ﬁne-grained
dataset should have a smaller N compared with a coarse-
grained one. For example, the number of unique prototypes
of a speciﬁc bird species should be smaller than the number
of unique prototypes of a generic bird class. Since classes in
CIFAR-100 are more ﬁne-grained than CIFAR-10, CIFAR-
100 should have smaller N compared with CIFAR-10. This
explains our observations on the effect of β.


5.4. Visual Recognition on Large-Scale Datasets


To demonstrate the proposed class-balanced loss can be
used on large-scale real-world datasets, we present results
of training ResNets with different depths on iNaturalist
2017, iNaturalist 2018 and ILSVRC 2012.

γ = 0.5 outperforms softmax cross-entropy after 60 epochs.


Table 3 summarizes the top-1 and top-5 error rate on the
validation set of all datasets. We use the class-balanced fo-
cal loss since it has more ﬂexibility and ﬁnd β = 0.999 and
γ = 0.5 yield reasonably good performance on all datasets.
From results we can see that we are able to outperform com-
monly used softmax cross-entropy loss on ILSVRC 2012,
and by large margins on iNaturalist. Notably, ResNet-50
is able to achieve comparable performance with ResNet-
152 on iNaturalist and ResNet-101 on ILSVRC 2012 when
using class-balanced focal loss to replace softmax cross-
entropy loss. Training curves on ILSVRC 2012 and iNatu-
ralist 2018 are shown in Figure 7. Class-balanced focal loss
starts to show its advantage after 60 epochs of training.


6. Conclusion and Discussion


In this work, we have presented a theoretically sounded
framework to address the problem of long-tailed distribu-
tion of training data. The key idea is to take data over-
lap into consideration to help quantify the effective number


of samples. Following this framework, we further propose
a class-balanced loss to re-weight loss inversely with the
effective number of samples per class. Extensive studies on
artiﬁcially induced long-tailed CIFAR datasets have been
conducted to understand and analyze the proposed loss. The
beneﬁt of the class-balanced loss has been veriﬁed by exper-
iments on both CIFAR and large-scale datasets including
iNaturalist and ImageNet.


Our proposed framework provides a non-parametric
means of quantifying data overlap, since we don’t make
any assumptions about the data distribution. This makes our
loss generally applicable to a wide range of existing models
and loss functions. Intuitively, a better estimation of the ef-
fective number of samples could be obtained if we know the
data distribution. In the future, we plan to extend our frame-
work by incorporating reasonable assumptions on the data
distribution or designing learning-based, adaptive methods.

Visual Recognition on Long-Tailed CIFAR. On long-
tailed CIFAR datasets with imbalance factors of 200, 100,
50, 20 and 10, we trained ResNet-32 models [16] using soft-
max loss (SM), sigmoid loss (SGM) and focal loss with both
the original loss and class-balanced variants with β = 0.9,
0.99, 0.999 and 0.9999. For focal loss, we used γ = 0.5, 1.0
and 2.0. In addition to long-tailed CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-
100 datasets mentioned in Section 5.1 of the main paper, we
also conduct experiments on CIFAR-20 dataset, which has
same images as CIFAR-100 dataset but annotated with 20
coarse-grained class-labels [24].


Classiﬁcation error rates on long-tailed CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-20 and CIFAR-100 datasets are shown in Figure 8,
Figure 9 and Figure 10 respectively. Each row in the ﬁgure
corresponds to the model trained with a speciﬁc loss func-
tion, in the form of {loss name} {γ} {β}, and each column
corresponds to a long-tailed dataset with speciﬁc imbalance
factor. We color-code each column to visualize results, with
lighter colors represent lower error rates and darker colors
for higher error rates. Note that results in each column of
Table 2 in the main paper are classiﬁcation error rates using
the original losses and the best-performed class-balanced
loss that is same as the lowest error rates in the correspond-
ing column of Figure 8 and Figure 10 (marked by under-
line). From these results, we can see that in general, higher
β yields better performance on CIFAR-10. However, on
CIFAR-20 and CIFAR-100, lower β is needed to achieve
good performance, suggesting that we cannot directly re-
weight the loss by inverse class-frequency, but to re-weight
based on the effective number of samples. These results
support the analysis in Section 5.3 of our main paper.
