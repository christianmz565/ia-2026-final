Abstract


Object recognition techniques using convolutional neu-
ral networks (CNN) have achieved great success.
How-
ever, state-of-the-art object detection methods still perform
poorly on large vocabulary and long-tailed datasets, e.g.
LVIS. In this work, we analyze this problem from a novel
perspective: each positive sample of one category can be
seen as a negative sample for other categories, making the
tail categories receive more discouraging gradients. Based
on it, we propose a simple but effective loss, named equal-
ization loss, to tackle the problem of long-tailed rare cat-
egories by simply ignoring those gradients for rare cate-
gories. The equalization loss protects the learning of rare
categories from being at a disadvantage during the network
parameter updating. Thus the model is capable of learn-
ing better discriminative features for objects of rare classes.
Without any bells and whistles, our method achieves AP
gains of 4.1% and 4.8% for the rare and common categories
on the challenging LVIS benchmark, compared to the Mask
R-CNN baseline. With the utilization of the effective equal-
ization loss, we ﬁnally won the 1st place in the LVIS Chal-
lenge 2019. Code has been made available at: https:

1. Introduction


Recently, the computer vision community has witnessed
the great success of object recognition because of the
emerge of deep learning and convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Object recognition, which is a fundamental task in
computer vision, plays a central role in many related tasks,
such as re-identiﬁcation, human pose estimation and object
tracking.


Today, most datasets for general object recognition, e.g.
Pascal VOC [10] and COCO [28], mainly collect frequently
seen categories, with a large number of annotations for each


Figure 1: The overall gradient analysis on positive and neg-
ative samples. We collect the average L2 norm of gradient
of weights in the last classiﬁer layer. Categories’ indices are
sorted by their instance counts. Note that for one category,
proposals of all the other categories and the background are
negative samples for it.


class. However, when it comes to more practical scenarios,
a large vocabulary dataset with a long-tailed distribution
of category frequency (e.g. LVIS [15]) is inevitable. The
problem of the long-tailed distribution of the categories is
a great challenge to the learning of object detection mod-
els, especially for the rare categories (categories with very
few samples). Note that for one category, all the samples
of other categories including the background are regarded
as negative samples. So the rare categories can be easily
overwhelmed by the majority categories (categories with a
large number of samples) during training and are inclined
to be predicted as negatives. Thus the conventional object
detectors trained on such an extremely unbalanced dataset

category, and the y-axis is the average predicted probability

suffer a great decline.


Most of the previous works consider the inﬂuence of
the long-tailed category distribution problem as an imbal-
ance of batch sampling during training, and they handle the
problem mainly by designing specialized sampling strate-
gies [2, 16, 32, 38]. Other works introduce specialized loss
formulations to cope with the problem of positive-negative
sample imbalance [27, 25]. But they focus on the imbal-
ance between foreground and background samples so that
the severe imbalance among different foreground categories
remains a challenging problem.


In this work, we focus on the problem of extremely
imbalanced frequencies among different foreground cate-
gories and propose a novel perspective to analyze the ef-
fect of it. As illustrated in Figure 1, the green and orange
curves represent the average norms of gradients contributed
by positive and negative samples respectively. We can see
that for the frequent categories, the positive gradient has a
larger impact than the negative gradient on average, but for
the rare categories, the status is just the opposite. To put
it further, the commonly used loss functions in classiﬁca-
tion tasks, e.g. softmax cross-entropy and sigmoid cross-
entropy, have a suppression effect on the classes that are not
the ground-truth one. When a sample of a certain class is
utilized for training, the parameters of the prediction of the
other classes will receive discouraging gradients which lead
them to predict low probabilities. Since the objects of the
rare categories hardly occur, the predictors for these classes
are overwhelmed by the discouraging gradients during net-
work parameters updating.


To address this problem, we propose a novel loss func-
tion, equalization loss (EQL). In general, we introduce a
weight term for each class of each sample, which mainly
reduces the inﬂuence of negative samples for the rare cat-


egories. The complete formulation of equalization loss is
presented in Section 3. With the equalization loss, the av-
erage gradient norm of negative samples decrease as shown
in Figure 1 (the blue curve). And a simple visualization of
the effect of EQL is shown in Figure 2, which illustrates the
average predicted probabilities for the positive proposals of
each category with (the red curve) and without (the blue
curve) equalization loss. It can be seen that EQL signiﬁ-
cantly improves the performance on rare categories without
harming the accuracy of frequent categories. With the pro-
posed EQL, categories of different frequencies are brought
to a more equal status during network parameter updating,
and the trained model is able to distinguish objects of the
rare categories more accurately.


Extensive experiments on several unbalanced datasets,
e.g. Open Images [23] and LVIS [15], demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our method. We also verify our method on
other tasks, like image classiﬁcation.


Our key contributions can be summarized as follows: (1)
We propose a novel perspective to analyze the long-tailed
problem: the suppression on rare categories during learning
caused by the inter-class competition, which explains the
poor performance of rare categories on long-tailed datasets.
Based on this perspective, a novel loss function, equaliza-
tion loss is proposed, which alleviates the effect of the over-
whelmed discouraging gradients during learning by intro-
ducing an ignoring strategy. (2) We present extensive ex-
periments over different datasets and tasks, like object de-
tection, instance segmentation and image classiﬁcation. All
experiments demonstrate the strength of our method, which
brings a large performance boosting over common classiﬁ-
cation loss functions. Equipped with our equalization loss,
we achieved the 1st place in the LVIS Challenge 2019.


2. Related Works


We ﬁrst revisit common objection detection and in-
stance segmentation. Then we introduce re-sampling, cost-
sensitive re-weighting, and feature manipulation methods
that are widely used to alleviate the class-unbalanced prob-
lem in long-tailed datasets.


Object Detection and Instance Segmentation. There
are two mainstream frameworks for objection detection:
single-stage detector [29, 36, 27] and two-stage detector
[13, 12, 37, 26, 31]. While single-stage detectors achieve
higher speed, most of state-of-the-art detectors follow the
two-stage regime for better performance. The popular Mask
R-CNN [17], which extends a mask head in the typical two-
stage detector, provided promising results on many instance
segmentation benchmarks. Mask Scoring R-CNN [21] in-
troduced an extra mask score head to align the mask’s score
and quality. And Cascade Mask R-CNN [1] and HTC [3]
further improved the performance by predicting the mask
in a cascade manner.


Re-sampling Methods.
One of the commonly used
methods in re-sampling is oversampling [2, 16, 32], which
randomly samples more training data from the minority
classes, to tackle the unbalanced class distribution. Class-
aware sampling [38], also called class-balanced sampling,
is a typical technique of oversampling, which ﬁrst samples
a category and then an image uniformly that contains the
sampled category.
While oversampling methods achieve
signiﬁcant improvement for under-represented classes, they
come with a high potential risk of overﬁtting. On the oppo-
site of oversampling, the main idea of under-sampling [9]
is to remove some available data from frequent classes to
make the data distribution more balanced. However, the
under-sampling is infeasible in extreme long-tailed datasets,
since the imbalance ratio between the head class and tail
class are extremely large. Recently, [22] proposed a de-
coupling training schema, which ﬁrst learns the representa-
tions and classiﬁer jointly, then obtains a balanced classiﬁer
by re-training the classiﬁer with class-balanced sampling.
Our method helps the model learn better representations for
tail classes, so it could be complementary to the decoupling
training schema.


Re-weighting Methods. The basic idea of re-weighting
methods is to assign weights for different training samples.
In an unbalanced dataset, an intuitive strategy is to weight
samples based on the inverse of class frequency [41, 20]
or use a smoothed version, inverse square root of class fre-
quency [33]. Besides methods mentioned above which ad-
just the weight on class level, there are other studies focus
on re-weighting on sample level. [27, 25] make the neu-
ral network to be cost-sensitive by increasing the weight
for hard samples and decreasing the weight for easy sam-
ples, which can be seen as online versions of hard exam-
ple mining technique [39]. Recently, Meta-Weight-Net [40]
learns an explicit mapping for sample re-weighting. Differ-
ent from the works above, we focus on the imbalance prob-
lem among different foreground categories. We propose a
new perspective that the large number of negative gradients
from frequent categories severely suppress the learning of
rare categories during training. And we propose a new loss
function to tackle this problem, which is applied to the sam-
ple level and class level simultaneously.


Feature Manipulation.
There are also some works
operating on the feature representations directly.
Range
Loss [44] enlarges inter-classes distance and reduces intra-
classes variations simultaneously. [43] augments the feature
space of tail classes by transferring the feature variance of
regular classes that have sufﬁcient training samples. [30]
transfers the semantic feature representation from head to
tail categories by adopting a memory module. However,
designing those modules or methods is not a trivial task and
makes the model harder to train. In contrast, our method is
simpler and does not access the representation directly.


3. Equalization Loss


The central goal of our equalization loss is to alleviate
the category quantity distribution imbalance problem for
each category in a long-tailed class distribution. We start
by revisiting conventional loss functions for classiﬁcation,
namely softmax cross-entropy and sigmoid cross-entropy.


3.1. Review of Cross-Entropy Loss


Softmax Cross-Entropy derives a multinomial distribu-
tion p over each category from the network outputs z, and
then computes the cross-entropy between the estimated dis-
tribution p and ground-truth distribution y. The softmax
cross-entropy loss LSCE can be formulated as:


LSCE = −


C
X


j=1


yj log(pj)
(1)


and C is the number of categories. Here, p is calculated by
Softmax(z). Note that the C categories include an extra
class for background. In practice, y uses one-hot represen-
tation, and we have PC


j=1 yj = 1. Formally, for the ground
truth category c of a sample,


yj =


(


1
if j = c
0
otherwise
(2)


Sigmoid Cross-Entropy estimates the probability of
each category independently using C sigmoid loss func-
tions. The ground truth label yj only represents a binary
distribution for category j. Usually, an extra category for
background is not included. Instead, yj = 0 will be set
for all the categories when a proposal belongs to the back-
ground. So the sigmoid cross-entropy loss can be formu-
lated as:


LBCE = −


C
X


j


log( ˆpj)
(3)


where


ˆpj =


(


pj
if yj = 1
1 −pj
otherwise
(4)


Where pj is calculated by σ(zj).
The derivative of the
LBCE and LSCE with respect to network’s output z in sig-
moid cross entropy shares the same formulation:


∂Lcls


∂zj


=


(


pj −1
if yj = 1
pj
otherwise
(5)


In softmax cross-entropy and sigmoid cross-entropy, we
notice that for a foreground sample of category c, it can be
regarded as a negative sample for any other category j. So
the category j will receive a discouraging gradient pj for
model updating, which will lead the network to predict low


probability for category j. If j is a rare category, the dis-
couraging gradients will occur much more frequently than
encouraging gradients during the iterations of optimization.
The accumulated gradients will have a non-negligible im-
pact on that category. Finally, even positive samples for
category j might get a relatively low probability from the
network.


3.2. Equalization Loss Formulation


When the quantity distribution of categories is fairly im-
balanced, e.g. in a long-tailed dataset, the discouraging gra-
dients from frequent categories have a remarkable impact
on categories with scarce annotations.
With commonly
used cross-entropy losses, the learning of rare categories
are easily suppressed. To solve this problem, we propose
the equalization loss, which ignores the gradient from sam-
ples of frequent categories for the rare categories. This loss
function aims to make the network training more fair for
each class, and we refer it as equalization loss.


Formally, we introduce a weight term w to the original
sigmoid cross-entropy loss function, and the equalization
loss can be formulated as:


LEQL = −


C
X


j=1


wjlog( ˆpj)
(6)


For a region proposal r, we set w with the following regu-
lations:


wj = 1 −E(r)Tλ(fj)(1 −yj)
(7)


In this equation, E(r) outputs 1 when r is a foreground re-
gion proposal and 0 when it belongs to background. And
fj is the frequency of category j in the dataset, which is
computed by the image number of the class j over the im-
age number of the entire dataset. And Tλ(x) is a threshold
function which outputs 1 when x < λ and 0 otherwise. λ
is utilized to distinguish tail categories from all other cat-
egories and Tail Ratio (TR) is used as the criterion to set
the value of it. Formally, we deﬁne TR by the following
formula:


TR(λ) =


PC


j Tλ(fj)Nj
PC


j Nj


(8)


where Nj is the image number of category j. The settings
of hyper-parameters of each part in Equation 7 are studied
in Section 4.4.


In summary, there are two particular designs in equaliza-
tion loss function: 1) We ignore the discouraging gradients
of negative samples for rare categories whose quantity fre-
quency is under a threshold. 2) We do not ignore the gra-
dients of background samples. If all the negative samples
for the rare categories are ignored, there will be no nega-
tive samples for them during training, and the learned model
will predict a large number of false positives.


3.3. Extend to Image Classiﬁcation


Since softmax loss function is widely adopted in image
classiﬁcation, we also design a form of Softmax Equaliza-
tion Loss following our main idea. Softmax equalization
loss (SEQL) can be formulated as:


LSEQL = −


C
X


j=1


yj log( ˜pj)
(9)


where


˜pj =
ezj
PC


k=1 ˜
wkezk
(10)


and the weight term wk is computed by:


˜
wk = 1 −βTλ(fk)(1 −yk)
(11)


where β is a random variable with a probability of γ to be 1
and 1 −γ to be 0.


Note that image classiﬁcation is different from classiﬁ-
cation in object detection: each image belongs to a speciﬁc
category, so there is no background category. Therefore, the
weight term ˜
wk does not have the part E(r) as in Equation
7. Therefore, we introduce β to randomly maintain the gra-
dient of negative samples. And the inﬂuence of γ is studied
in Section 6.


4. Experiments on LVIS


We conduct extensive experiments for equalization loss.
In this section, we ﬁrst present the implementation de-
tails and the main results on the LVIS dataset [15] in Sec-
tion 4.2 and Section 4.3. Then we perform ablation studies
to analyze different components of equalization loss in Sec-
tion 4.4. In Section 4.5, we compare equalization loss with
other methods. Details of LVIS Challenge 2019 will be in-
troduced in Section 4.6.


4.1. LVIS Dataset


LVIS is a large vocabulary dataset for instance segmenta-
tion, which contains 1230 categories in current version v0.5.
In LVIS, categories are divided into three groups according
to the number of images that contains those categories: rare
(1-10 images), common (11-100), and frequent (>100). We
train our model on 57k train images and evaluate it on 5k
val set. We also report our results on 20k test images.
The evaluation metric is AP across IoU threshold from 0.5
to 0.95 over all categories. Different from COCO evaluation
process, since LVIS is a sparse annotated dataset, detection
results of categories that are not listed in the image level
labels will not be evaluated.

Table 1: Results on different frameworks and models. All those models use class-agnostic mask prediction and are evaluated
on LVIS v0.5 val set. AP is mask AP, and subscripts ’r’, ’c’ and ’f’ stand for rare, common and frequent categories
respectively. For equalization loss function, the λ is set as 1.76 × 10−3 to include all the rare and common categories.


4.2. Implementation Details


We implement standard Mask R-CNN [17] equipped
with FPN [26] as our baseline model. Training images are
resized such that its shorter edge is 800 pixels while the
longer edge is no more than 1333. No other augmentation is
used except horizontal ﬂipping. In the ﬁrst stage, RPN sam-
ples 256 anchors with a 1:1 ratio between the foreground
and background, and then 512 proposals are sampled per
image with 1:3 foreground-background ratio for the second
stage. We use 16 GPUs with a total batch size 32 for train-
ing. Our model is optimized by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) with momentum 0.9 and weight decay 0.0001 for 25
epochs, with an initial learning rate 0.04, which is decayed
to 0.004 and 0.0004 at 16 epoch and 22 epoch respectively.
Though class-speciﬁc mask prediction achieves better per-
formance, we adopt a class-agnostic regime in our method
due to the huge memory and computation cost for the large
scale categories. Following [15], the threshold of predic-
tion score is reduced from 0.05 to 0.0, and we keep the top
300 bounding boxes as prediction results. We make a small
modiﬁcation when EQL is applied on LVIS. Since for each
image LVIS provide additional image-level annotations of
which categories are in that image (positive category set)
and which categories are not in it (negative category set),
categories in EQL will not be ignored if they are in the pos-
itive category set or negative category set of that image, i.e.
the weight term of Equation 7 will be 1 for those categories,
even if they are rare ones.

loss function over different backbones and frameworks. Be-

provement on all those models. As we can see from the ta-
ble, the improvement mainly comes from the rare and com-
mon categories, indicating the effectiveness of our method
on categories of the long-tailed distribution.


4.4. Ablation Studies


To better analyze equalization loss, we conduct several
ablation studies.
For all experiments we use ResNet-50
Mask R-CNN.
Frequency Threshold λ: The inﬂuence of different λ is
shown in Table 2. We perform experiments of changing λ
from 1.76 × 10−4, which exactly split rare categories from
all categories, to a broad range. We empirically ﬁnd the
proper λ locating in the space when TR(λ) ranges from
2% to 10%. Results in Table 2 shows that signiﬁcant im-
provement of overall AP as λ increases to include more tail

tion Tλ(f).


categories. Meanwhile, the performance tends to degener-
ate when λ increases to include frequent categories. One
advantage of equalization loss is that it has negligible ef-
fect on categories whose frequency is larger than a given λ.
When λ = λr, APr improves signiﬁcantly with marginal
inﬂuence to APc and APf. And when λ = λc, APr and
APc improve a lot while APf only degenerates slightly. We
set λ to λc in all our experiments.
Threshold Function Tλ(f): In Equation 7, we use Tλ(fj)
to compute the weight of category j for a given proposal.
Except for the proposed threshold function, Tλ(f) can have
other forms to calculate the weight for the categories with
frequency under the threshold.
As illustrated in Figure
3, we present and compare with another two designs: (1)
Exponential decay function y = 1 −(af)n, which com-
putes the weight according to the power of category fre-
quency. (2) Gompertz decay function y = 1 −ae−be−cf ,
which decays smoothly at the beginning and then decreases
more steeply. We run multiple experiments for Exponential
decay function and Gompertz decay function with differ-
ent hyper-parameters and report the best results. The best
hyper-parameter settings for Exponential decay function is
a = 400 and n = 2 and for Gompertz decay function
a = 1, b = 80, c = 3000. Table 3 shows that all of the
three designs achieve fairly similar results, while both expo-
nential decay and Gompertz decay function introduce more
hyper-parameters to ﬁt the design. Therefore, we use the
threshold function in our method for its simpler format with
less hyper-parameters and better performance.
Excluding Function E(r): Table 4 shows the experiment
results for EQL with or without E(r). EQL without E(r)
means removing E(r) from Equation 7, which will treat
the foreground and background the same way. EQL with
E(r) means equalization loss only affects foreground pro-
posals, as deﬁned in Equation 7. Experiment results demon-

strate the importance of E(r). As we can see from the table,
with E(r), EQL achieves 0.6 points AP gain compared with
EQL without E(r). If E(r) is discarded, although APr has
an increase, APf drops dramatically, which causes the over-
all AP decline.


It is worth to notice that if we don’t use E(r), a large
number of background proposals will be also ignored for
rare and common categories, and the insufﬁcient supervi-
sion from background proposals will cause extensive false
positives. We visualize the detection results of an exam-
ple image, which is shown in Figure 4.
Without E(r),
more false positives are introduced, which are shown in red
color. Both analysis and illustration above indicate that APr
should decrease without E(r), which is contradictory with
the experiment results in Table 4. The reason is that accord-
ing to LVIS evaluation protocol, if it is not sure whether
category j is in or not in image I, all the false positives of
category j will be ignored in image I. If category j is rare,
the increased false positives are mostly ignored, which alle-
viates their inﬂuence. But the simultaneously increased true
positives bring a direct increase in APr.


4.5. Comparison with Other Methods


Table 5 presents the comparison with other methods that
are widely adopted to tackle the class imbalance problem.
According to the table, re-sampling methods improve APr
and APc at the sacriﬁce of APf, while re-weighting meth-
ods bring consistent gains on all categories but the overall
improvement is trivial. The equalization loss improves APr
and APc signiﬁcantly with slight effect on APf, surpassing
all other approaches.

Joint Recognition Challenge 2019. Combined with other
enhancements, like larger backbone [19, 42], deformable
convolution [6], synchronized batch normalization [35], and
extra data, our method achieves a 28.9 mask AP on LVIS
v0.5 test set, outperforming the ResNeXt-101 Mask R-

our experiments, we use the split of data and the subset of
the categories of the competition 2019 for object detection
track (OID19). The train set of OID19 contains 12.2M
bounding boxes over 500 categories on 1.7M images, and
the val contains about 10k images.


According to Table 6, our method achieves a great im-
provement compared with standard sigmoid cross-entropy,
outperforming class-aware sampling method by a signiﬁ-
cant margin. To better understand the improvement of our
methods, we group all the categories by their image num-
ber and report the performance of each group. We can see
that our method has larger improvements on categories with
fewer samples. Signiﬁcant AP gains on the group of fewest
100 categories are achieved compared with sigmoid cross-
entropy and class-aware sampling (2.6 and 10.88 points re-
spectively).

for the rarest category. CIFAR-100-LT shares the same test
set of 10k images with original CIFAR-100. We report the
top1 and top5 accuray. ImageNet-LT [30] is generated from
ImageNet-2012 [7], which contains 1000 categories with
images number ranging from 1280 to 5 images for each cat-
egory 2. There are 116k images for training and 50k images
for testing. Different from CIFAR-100-LT, we additionally
present accuracies of many shot, medium shot and few shot
to measure the improvement on tail classes.
Implementation Details. For CIFAR-100-LT, we use Nes-
terov SGD with momentum 0.9 and weight decay 0.0001
for training. We use a total mini-batch size of 256 with 128
images per GPU. The model ResNet-32 is trained for 12.8K
iterations with learning rate 0.2, which is then decayed by
a factor of 0.1 at 6.4K and 9.6K iteration. Learning rate is
increased gradually from 0.1 to 0.2 during the ﬁrst 400 it-
erations. For data augmentation, we ﬁrst follow the same
setting as [24, 18], then use autoAugment [4] and Cutout
[8]. In testing, we simply use the origin 32 × 32 images.
For ImageNet-LT, we use a total mini-batch size of 1024
with 16 GPUs. We use ResNet-10 as our backbone like
[30].The model is trained for 12K iterations with learning
rate 0.4, which is divided by 10 at 3.4K, 6.8K, 10.2K itera-
tions. A gradually warmup strategy [14] is also adopted to
increase the learning rate from 0.1 to 0.4 during the ﬁrst 500
iterations. We use random-resize-crop, color jitter and hor-
izontal ﬂipping as data augmentation. Training input size is

Results on CIFAR-100-LT and ImageNet-LT. We build a
much stronger baseline on CIFAR-100-LT due to those aug-
mentation techniques. As shown in Table 7, our EQL still
improves the strong baseline by a large margin of 2%. And
those improvements are come from classes with fewer train-
ing samples. As for ImageNet-LT, we also present ablation
studies in Table 9. A wide range of values of γ give con-
sistent improvements over the softmanx loss baseline. As
shown in Table 8 and Table 10, our equalization loss sur-
passes prior state-of-the-art approaches signiﬁcantly, which
demonstrates that our method can be generalized to differ-
ent tasks and datasets effectively.


7. Conclusion


In this work, we analyze the severe inter-class compe-
tition problem in long-tailed datasets. We propose a novel
equalization loss function to alleviate the effect of the over-
whelmed discouraging gradients on tail categories.
Our
method is simple but effective, bringing a signiﬁcant im-
provement over different frameworks and network architec-
tures on challenging long-tailed object detection and image
classiﬁcation datasets.

Appendix A. Details of LVIS Challenge 2019


With equalization loss, we ranked 1st entry on LVIS
Challenge 2019. In this section, we will introduce details
of the solution we used in the challenge.


External Data Exploiting Since LVIS is not exhaustively
annotated with all categories and the annotations for long-
tailed categories are quite scarce, we utilize additional pub-
lic datasets to enrich our training set. First, we train a Mask
R-CNN on COCO train2017 with 115k images and then
ﬁne-tune our model with equalization loss on LVIS. Dur-
ing ﬁne-tuning, we leverage COCO annotations of bound-
ing boxes as ignored regions to exclude background propos-
als during sampling. Moreover, we borrow ∼20k images
from Open Images V5 which contains shared 110 categories
with LVIS and use the bounding boxes annotations to train
the model.


Model Enhancements We achieve our challenge base-
line by training ResNeXt-101-64x4d [42] enhanced by de-
formable convolution [6] and synchronized batch normal-
ization [35], along with equalization loss, repeat factor sam-
pling , multi-scale training and COCO exploiting, which
lead to 30.1% AP on LVIS v0.5 val set. We apply multi-
scale testing on both bounding box and segmentation results
and the testing scale ranges from 600 to 1400 with step size
of 200. We train two expert models on train set of COCO
2017 and Open Images V5 respectively and then evaluate
them on LVIS val set to collect the detection results of
shared categories. Though our method improves the perfor-
mance of long-tailed categories a lot, the prediction scores
for these categories tend to be smaller than frequent ones
due to the lack of positive training samples, which leads to
degeneration of APr in ensemble. To keep more results for
rare and common categories, we employ a re-score ensem-
ble approach via improving the scores of these categories.


Our road map is shown in 11. With those enhancements,
we achieve 36.4 and 28.9 Mask AP on val and test set
respectively which is demonstrated in Table 12.
